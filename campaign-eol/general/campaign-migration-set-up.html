    <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>MAP and CRM systems are great at storing data about user behavior. They are generally less effective at analyzing that data and identifying patterns that you can act on. This is where Brightcove's Audience Insights technology can provide valuable insights into your data to help you make good business decisions.</p>
    <p>Here are some examples of the kind of campaigns you might run based on the insights Brightcove provides:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lead Qualification</strong>: Set different Segment tags to build a Lead Score in your Marketing Platform. Qualify them and move them along the funnel.</li>
      <li><strong>Ideal Customer Persona (ICP)</strong>: Identify your ICP and create a segment that will report every viewer with similar behavior to run a targeted campaign. Identify viewer preferences, patterns, and engagement to cater to the specific cohort through targeted messaging and campaigns.</li>
      <li><strong>Content promotion</strong>: Engage a prospect that has watched a specific video with related content.</li>
      <li><strong>Subscription Management</strong>: Identify different segments of customers to lead them through their subscription or upgrade journey. Examples of Subscription management campaigns based on Segments are: Engage trialist, Updated Onboarding Flow, Idle users, Annual Plan Upgrades, Scheduled Cancellation Win-backs, Lost Customer Win-backs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="Set_up_an_integration">Set up an integration</h2>
    <p>Setting up an integration is straightforward. However, you will need some information from the third-party vendor - exactly what you need will vary for different services, but will be clearly indicated by input fields in the setup dialog. Typical requirements are "Account id", "API key", and/or "Secret key". If you are unsure how to find or obtain a required piece of information, consult the vendor's documentation or support service.</p>

    <h2 id="viewer-id">Viewer ID Tracking plugin</h2>
    <p>The Brightcove Viewer ID tracking plugin is a key feature for content creators and video platform owners aiming to gain in-depth insights into their audience by assigning and tracking viewers through unique IDs. This tool is vital for analyzing viewer behavior, content preferences, and engagement patterns, enabling tailored content and targeted marketing strategies for enhanced viewer experience and engagement.</p>
    <h3>Create a new Player or Edit an existing Player</h3>
    <p>If you are editing an existing Campaign player, you will also want to remove the existing <strong>Campaign plugin</strong>. However, you could also create a <strong>New Player</strong>.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Open the <strong>Campaign</strong> module.</li>
      <li>Deselect the Enable <strong>Campaign</strong> checkbox.</li>
      <li>Click <span class="button-blue">Save</span> and <span class="button-blue">Publish</span> your player.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Enable the Viewer ID Tracking Plugin</h3>
    <p>You can enable the Viewer ID Tracking Plugin by taking the following steps from the player details view:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Open the <strong>Viewer ID Tracking</strong> tab.</li>
      <li>Select the Enable <strong>Viewer ID Tracking</strong> checkbox.</li>
      <li>Choose the 3rd Party Service from the Service dropdown.</li>
      <li>Input any additional required fields.</li>
      <li>Click <span class="button-blue">Save</span> and <span class="button-blue">Publish</span> your player.</li>
    </ol>

  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="setuo-interactivity-player">Setup your Interactivity Player</h2>
    <p>We first have to enable your Player for Interactivity and ensure that any videos played inside of this player have “Interactivity Projects” that can receive Lead Forms. To do this follow the next steps:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Open the <em>Interactivity</em> tab in the Player Details section on the <strong>Players Module</strong>.</li>
      <li>Select the <strong>Enable Interactivity</strong> checkbox.</li>
      <li>To enable the auto-creation of Interactivity projects, select the <strong>Options (JSON)</strong> checkbox. This reveals a textarea where you can insert a JSON configuration.</li>
      <li>Inside the textarea, insert the following JSON.
        <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-json" translate="No">{
   "create": true
 }
         </code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>Click <span class="button-blue">Save</span> and <span class="button-blue">Publish</span> your player.</li>
      
    </ol>
    <p>Once the changes have taken effect, any video played within this Player has a Project created automatically.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: When Projects are created from videos, any tags defined in the <em>Media Module</em> are also copied over to the new Project. It’s worth taking an extra step here to come up with a unique tag for any videos you’d like to apply a lead form to and apply them to your videos inside of the Media Module.</aside>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="setuo-lead-form">Setup your Lead Form</h2>
    <p>Now that you have an <em>Interactivity Player</em>, we need to create a <em>Lead Form</em> to apply to the videos you load in the <em>Interactivity Player</em>. To create a <em>Lead Form</em> follow the next steps:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Open the <strong>Interactivity Module</strong>.</li>
      <li>Click to <strong>Templates > All Templates</strong>.</li>
      <li>Click <span class="button-blue">New template</span> and provide a descriptive name.</li>
      <li>On the Template details screen, you are presented with a 1-minute dummy video that you can work on.
        <ul>
          <li>If you just plan on having the lead form opening at the start of every video, or within 1 minute of playback, then you can continue with the existing dummy video.</li>
          <li>If you would like a lead form to appear at a specific time above 60 seconds (such as 5 minutes into a video), then you will need to use the <strong>Replace Video</strong> button to select a video of the correct length to create your template.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Use the player control bar to create a new <strong>Lead Form Annotation</strong>.
      <ul>
        <li>On the <strong>Form Source</strong> tab, copy & paste the lead form code you previously used in Campaign - or directly from your <em>MAP</em>.
          <ul>
            <li>Select whether or not you wish to <strong>Require Submission</strong>.
            <ul>
              <li>Selecting this option will require viewers to fill out the form before playback resumes.</li>
              <li>Not selecting this option will display a `Close` button in the upper right corner of the lead form, where viewers can resume playback without filling out the form</li>
              
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Select whether or not you wish to <strong>Show form everytime</strong>.
            <ul>
              <li>If unselected, the lead form will only display if it’s determined that the viewer is not yet known.</li>
            </ul></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Use the <strong>Time</strong> Tab to modify the time at which the Lead Form should appear.
        <ul>
          <li>This can be an exact playback time in hh:mm:ss or a percentage of playback.</li>
          <li>Video playback will pause and seek the user back to this time until the user has successfully closed or submitted the lead form annotation at which point the main content will resume</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Click <span class="button-blue">Save</span></li>
      </ul>
