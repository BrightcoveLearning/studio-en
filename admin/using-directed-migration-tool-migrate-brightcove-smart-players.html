    <h2 id="create">Creating a mapping</h2>
    <p>Mappings are used to specify that a Smart Player should be replaced with a Brightcove Player. To create a new mapping, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li> Click   <strong>Admin</strong>  in the Studio header. </li>
      <li> Click  <strong>Player Settings</strong>. </li>
      <li> Click <strong>Create Mapping</strong> . A list of Smart Players in the account will be displayed.
        <div> <img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Create mapping" src="/assets/images/admin/node16627-create-mapping.png" /> </div>
      </li>
      <li> Select one or more Smart Players to replace with a Brightcove Player. Click <strong>Next</strong> . </li>
      <li> Select a Brightcove Player to use in place of the Smart Player(s). When a Brightcove Player is selected, a preview of the player will be displayed.
        <div> <img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Select Brightcove Player" src="/assets/images/admin/node16627-select-bc-player.png" /> </div>
      </li>
      <li> Click <strong>Next</strong> . Instructions for <a href="#test">testing player mappings</a> will be displayed.
        <p class="BCL-aside">Note: Player mappings can take up to 5 minutes to take effect.</p>
      </li>
      <li> Click<span class="button-blue">Save</span> . A list of current mappings will be displayed.
        <div> <img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Player mappings" src="/assets/images/admin/node16627-mappings-list.png" /> </div>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p> After creating a mapping, the status will be <strong>Testing</strong> . Once the <a href="#test">mapping has been tested</a> and committed, the status will be <strong>Committed</strong> . Mappings marked with a status of <strong>Committed</strong> will render a Brightcove Player instead of the Smart Player. </p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="test">Testing player mappings</h2>
    <p>You should test any player mappings that are created before they are committed. To test a player mapping, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li> Find a page that displays your legacy Smart Player.
        <div> <img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Smart Player Example" src="/assets/images/admin/node16627-smart-player.png" /> </div>
      </li>
      <li> Add the <code translate="No">enableMapping=true</code> parameter to the page URL.
        <ul>
          <li> If the page URL doesn't have URL parameters, add <code translate="No">?enableMapping=true</code> to the end of the URL. For example: <br />
            <code translate="No">http://www.mysite.com/videos.html?enableMapping=true</code> </li>
          <li> If the page URL has URL parameters, add <code translate="No">&amp;enableMapping=true</code> to the end of the URL. For example: <br />
            <code translate="No">http://www.mysite.com/videos.html?myparams=true&amp;enableMapping=true</code> </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The newly mapped Brightcove Player should display and the video should play.</p>
        <div> <img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Brightcove  Player Example" src="/assets/images/admin/node16627-brightcove-player.png" /> </div>
        <p>When you are satisfied with how the player is working, return to Video Cloud Studio.</p>
      </li>
      <li> Select the checkbox next to the player mapping and click <strong>Commit Mapping</strong> to make the new Brightcove Player visible to all site visitors. </li>
