    <p>The User Management page manages the users who are authorized to use the Studio. Note that to access the User Management page, you must be a user with the Administrator role.</p>
    <p>To access the User Management page:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Log in to Studio.</li>
      <li>In the navigation header, click <strong>ADMIN</strong> and then <strong>User Management</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The User Management page will display:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Last Name, First Name</li>
      <li>Email address</li>
      <li>Role - Standard or Administrator</li>
      <li>Module Access - Each module the user has access to will display a green check mark (<img alt="" src="/assets/images/admin/node14054-green-check-icon.png" />)</li>
      <li>Last Login - The last date and time the user logged in to Video Cloud Studio. This is the last login for all Video Cloud Studio accounts, not just the current account</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The User Management page can be used to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#create">Create new users</a></li>
      <li><a href="#edit">Edit existing users</a></li>
      <li><a href="#delete">Delete a user</a></li>

    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="many">How many users can I have?</h2>
    <p>The number of users you can create depends on what kind of account you have. If you need to add more users, you can upgrade your plan to one that offers more users. The limit applies only to the total number of users in existence at any time; if you create 10 users, delete 5 of them, and create 3 more users, you are considered to have 8 users. The Users page displays how many users you are entitled to and how many additional users you can create.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="purchase">Purchasing additional users</h2>

        </ul>

    <h2 id="users">Working with multiple accounts</h2>
    <p>A common misconception when adding an additional account is that you get an additional 10 users just like you did with your first Video Cloud account. Additional Video Cloud accounts do not include additional user accounts. For example, if 10 users were added to the first account and the same 10 users are added to the second account, the total user count is still 10. The 10 unique users are per the license agreement and a single unique user ID can be used on multiple accounts and still be counted as one user.</p>
    <p>If you have multiple accounts, users must be added to each account individually. Assume you have 2 accounts, Account A and Account B. If a user is added to Account A, they will not automatically have access to Account B. Users must be added to each account they need access to.</p>
