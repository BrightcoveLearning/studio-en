      <p>Note: we have encountered some cases where the Social module does not load. Most often this appears to be caused by the user's network blocking the Facebook library: <code translate="no">https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js</code>.</p>
      <p>This is especially common in Firefox, due to the Enhanced Tracking Protection, which blocks the Facebook SDK by default. For information and instructions on adjusting these settings, see <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop">Enhanced Tracking Protection in Firefox for desktop</a>.</p>
