      <li><strong>Dashboard</strong> - Provides a high level overview of video performance on social media accounts. Covered in this topic.</li>
      <li><strong>Social Views</strong> - Provides an overview of the social view for videos shared to social media accounts. For information, see <a href="/social/reviewing-social-views-analytics.html">Reviewing Social Views Analytics</a>.</li>

    <p>The Dashboard is organized into the following sections:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#videoviews">Video views at a glance</a></li>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="timespan">Selecting a time span</h2>
    <p>To specify the time period for the reports, you can click on a quick date or use the calendar control. Social analytics data always uses the GMT time zone.</p>
    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>Using a quick date</h3>
      <p>A series of quick dates are at the top of the page. The following quick dates are available:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Last 7 days</li>
        <li>Last 30 days</li>
        <li>Previous month</li>
        <li>2 months ago</li>
      </ul>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="videoviews">Video views at a glance</h2>
    <p>The Video Views at a Glance section will display the number of video views from Video Cloud players, Facebook, YouTube and total views for the time period selected. The Updated date is the latest date that Video Cloud has social analytics data for. Typically, there is a 24-48+ hour delay before social platforms update the views and engagement data in their APIs.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: The button "Create Post With Video" in Facebook analytics will create a new secondary post of your video added to the one created by Brightcove Social, causing the appearance of two identical video posts. Brightcove Social Analytics will only present the data from the original one.</aside>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="views at a glance" src="/assets/images/social/node16643-video-views.png" /></figure>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: The Twitter Insights APIs don't report media views therefore viewing data is not available as part of the social analytics.</aside>
    <p>Clicking on the <strong>MY SITES &amp; APPS</strong> link will open the Video Cloud Analytics Performance Report.</p>
    <p>Note that views are counted differently by each social media platform:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>My Sites &amp; Apps</strong> - Video Cloud counts a video view when a video begins to play</li>
      <li><strong>Facebook</strong> - Video view counted when viewer watches a video for at least 3 seconds</li>
      <li><strong>YouTube</strong> - Video view counted when viewer watches a video for "around" 30 seconds</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="topdest">Top destinations</h2>
    <p>The Top Destinations section will display the top 5 destinations that had the most views for the time period selected.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="top destinations" src="/assets/images/social/node16643-top-dest.png" /></figure>
    <p>Clicking on the video title will open the <a href="/social/reviewing-social-views-analytics.html">social views analytics</a> for that video.</p>

  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="trend">Video views trend</h2>
    <p>The Video Views Trend graph will display the number of video views for the videos posted to your social media accounts for the time period selected. Hovering over a line in the graph will display the data for that date.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: The Twitter Insights APIs don't report media views therefore viewing data is not available as part of the social analytics.</aside>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="video views trend" src="/assets/images/social/node16643-video-views-graph.png" /></figure>
    <p>The legend to the right of the graph can be used to select the level of detail to display:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>My Sites &amp; Apps</strong> - Display the number of video views from Video Cloud players and apps</li>
      <li><strong>Facebook</strong> - Display the number of video views on Facebook</li>
      <li><strong>YouTube</strong> - Display the number of video views on YouTube</li>
      <li><strong>Total</strong> - Display the total number of video views across all platforms</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The YouTube views shown in the analytics reports are collected from the <a href="https://youtube.com/analytics">YouTube Analytics Overview</a> report. YouTube does not guarantee that this data is real-time data. Therefore, you may see delays of several days before the views and engagement appear in this report. Once the data is in the YouTube Analytics, it will be picked up by the nightly data collectors for the Brightcove Social Analytics.</p>
    <p>If you need more recent real-time viewing data, YouTube also provides <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6096647">real-time reports</a> with estimates of viewing data during the past 48 hours for your top 25 most recently published videos. You can find the real-time report for your YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/analytics?o=U#r=realtime">here</a>. Brightcove Social Analytics is not collecting this real-time data since it provides estimated views (as opposed to actuals) and only applies to recent videos.</p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="deletedvideos">Deleted videos</h2>
    <p>How social analytics appear for deleted videos depends on how the video was distributed, and, if the video was AutoSync'd, what the AutoSync settings were.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the video was distributed using the social publish feature, deleting it from Video Cloud does not remove the video from the social platform and Social will continue to collect analytics for the video</li>
      <li>If the video was distributed using the AutoSync feature, deleting it from Video Cloud may delete the video from the social platform, depending on the AutoSync settings:
        <ul>
          <li>If the 'Delete distributed video on &lt;social platform&gt;' option was selected, then the Social module would have removed the video from the social platform and would stop trying to collect analytics data.</li>
          <li>If any of the options that leave the video on the social platform (exact details of these options vary from platform to platform) were chosen, then the Social module will continue to attempt to collect analytics for it.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Social analytics will continue to display any existing social analytics data for videos that have been deleted</li>
    </ul>
