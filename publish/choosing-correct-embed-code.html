    <p>When publishing videos using the Media module, you can use the player URL to preview the video or copy the iframe or In-Page embed code to paste into your web page or application.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Click the <strong>Shorten</strong> button next to the preview URL to generate&nbsp;a shortened preview URL.</aside>
    <p >The <strong>Standard</strong> link displays the iframe embed code and the <strong>Advanced</strong> link displays the In-Page embed code. From the Player Management API perspective, you will also see the <strong>Advanced</strong> player code referred to as the <strong>embed_in_page</strong> implementation.</p>

    <h2 id="iframe">iframe embed code (Standard)</h2>
    <p>Typical iframe embed code will appear as follows:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-html" translate="No">&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://players.brightcove.net/1507807800001/rf1BTdKk6M_default/index.html?videoId=6116779877001&quot;
  allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;
  allow=&quot;encrypted-media&quot;
  width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;540&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>Some advantages of using the iframe embed code</p>
    <ul>
      <li>No collisions with existing JavaScript and/or CSS</li>
      <li>Automatically responsive</li>
      <li>The iframe eases use in social media apps or whenever the video will need to be used in an outside environment; for instance, Facebook will perceive the security threat is much less when the iframe is used versus putting the <code translate="No">&lt;video&gt;</code> tag and associated JavaScript on their site (which Facebook does not allow)</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: If you are publishing a Campaign-enabled Brightcove Player, use the Advanced Embed (in-page) publishing code.  Using the Standard Embed (iframe) publishing code will not work as the plugin will be running inside of an iframe and therefore will be unable to access any parent page URL parameters and may not get the correct cookies.</aside>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="inpage">In-Page embed code (Advanced)</h2>
    <p>Typical in-page embed code will appear as follows:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-html" translate="No">&lt;video-js data-account=&quot;1507807800001&quot;
  data-player=&quot;rf1BTdKk6M&quot;
  data-embed=&quot;default&quot;
  controls=&quot;&quot;
  data-video-id=&quot;6116779877001&quot;
  data-playlist-id=&quot;&quot;
  data-application-id=&quot;&quot;
  width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;540&quot;&gt;&lt;/video-js&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://players.brightcove.net/1507807800001/rf1BTdKk6M_default/index.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>Although integrating the In-Page publishing code can be more complex, using the In-Page code is best when the page containing the player needs to communicate with the player. Some examples of when to use the In-Page embed code include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The code in the containing page needs to listen for and act on player events</li>
      <li>The player uses styles from the parent page</li>
      <li>The iframe code will cause application logic to fail, like a redirect from the parent page</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Even if your final implementation does not use the iframe embed&nbsp;code, you can still use the In-Page code with a plugin for your JavaScript and a separate file for your CSS. This encapsulates your logic so that you can easily use it in multiple players.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: If you selected the iframe implementation when publishing from Studio, you will see the option <code translate="No">allowfullscreen</code> added in the iframe. If you are ever manually placing a Brightcove Player, either the in-page embed or iframe implementation, in an iframe you should also include this option for proper fullscreen functionality. If for some reason you nest a player in multiple iframes, all iframes should have the option added.</aside>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="recommend">Recommendation</h2>
    <p>It is considered a best practice to use the Standard (iframe)) implementation unless some application logic requires the use of the Advanced (in-page) code. If you are using the Audience module to track viewer engagement, the Advanced (in-page)) embed code must be used.</p>
