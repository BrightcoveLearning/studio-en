    <h2 id="steps">Publishing videos and playlists</h2>
    <p>To publish a video or playlist, follow these steps.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Click <strong>Media</strong> in the navigation header to open the Media module.</li>
      <li>To publish a single video, click <strong>All videos</strong> in the side navigation panel and then do one of the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Click the checkbox next to the video and then click  <span class="button-blue">Publish &amp; Embed </span>  &gt; Publish to web</strong></li>
          <li>Click on the video name and then click <span class="button-blue">Publish &amp; Embed </span>  &gt; Publish to web </strong>on the video properties page</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>To publish a playlist, click <strong>All playlists</strong> in the side navigation panel and then do one of the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Click the check box next to the playlist and then click  <span class="button-blue">Publish &amp; Embed </span>  &gt; Publish to web</strong></li>
          <li>Click on the playlist name and then click <strong>Publish Playlist </strong>on the playlist videos page</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Confirm that the publishing dialog opens. The name of the video or playlist being published will appear in the publishing dialog title.

        <p>Known Issue: Since the preview player is being loaded over HTTPS within the Studio, if your content is being served over HTTP, the preview player will not playback the content and your browser will display an insecure scripts message. This is not a Studio bug but a browser security limitation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Select a player to use. When publishing playlists, there are some playlist-related player properties that can be set to control <span class="BCL-objective"> appearance and behavior of the playlist</span>. See the <a href="#playlistprop">Setting playlist properties</a> section below for details.
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/publish/node15473-player-id.png" /></figure>
        <p>Note that the preview will update to display the player that was selected.</p>
      </li>
      <li>(Optional) The preview link below the preview player can be used to preview the player in another browser tab. Click the <strong>Shorten</strong> button to generate a shortened URL.</li>
      <li>Choose an option for the player sizing:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Responsive</strong> - The player size will adjust automatically based upon the browser size</li>
          <li><strong>Fixed</strong> - The player size is based upon the width and height parameters</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Select an aspect ratio for the player.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>16:9 </strong>or <strong>4:3 - </strong>enter a player width (the height will be determined automatically)</li>
          <li><strong>Custom</strong> - to manually enter the player width and height</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Enter the <strong>Player Width</strong> and <strong>Player Height</strong>.</li>
      <li>Select the <strong>Units</strong> of measurement.</li>
      <li>Select the type of publishing code to copy by clicking <strong>Standard</strong> or <strong>Advanced</strong>.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Standard - iframe embed code - Recommended for most cases.</strong> This type places the player inside an <code translate="No">&lt;iframe&gt;</code> tag. If player dimensions are specified, the iframe will be sized to the player dimensions. If no player dimensions are specified, the iframe can be placed inside of a <code translate="No">&lt;div&gt;</code> tag and the responsive nature of the player will resize the player to occupy the entire space of the <code translate="No">&lt;div&gt;</code>.
            <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: The iframe width must be larger than 640px for the playlist to appear.</aside>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Advanced - In-page embed code</strong> - Allows the player to exist in the the HTML page directly, not in an iframe. This offers developers the benefits of ease of accessing the player and associated properties and events. By using the in-page embed code, you lose the ease of use of the player as a single, contained unit in social media applications and sharing. This option is available only for the published player.</li>
        </ul>
        For more information on the types of publishing code, see <a href="/publish/choosing-correct-embed-code.html">Choosing the Correct Embed&nbsp;Code</a>.</li>
      <li>Copy the publishing code. When finished, click <strong>Close</strong>.</li>

    <h2 id="appid">Adding an application ID to the embed&nbsp;code</h2>
    <p>In the past, publishers would commonly create new players with different names to use on different parts of a site or to use on different sites. When reviewing player analytics, having different player names made it easier to determine which players were getting the most views. By adding an application ID parameter to the embed&nbsp;code, the same player can be used across a site, or sites, and the application ID can be used to identify where the player was published. Using a player application ID can help reduce the number of players that need to be created and maintained. For information on adding an application ID to the embed&nbsp;code, see <a href="/publish/adding-application-id-player-embed-code.html">Adding an Application ID to the Player Embed&nbsp;Code</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="playlistprop">Setting playlist properties</h2>
    <p>There are some playlist-related player properties that can be configured when working with playlists. <span class="BCL-objective">To configure the playlist-related player properties, </span>follow these steps.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Open the <strong>Players</strong> module.</li>
      <li>Click on the player name to open the player properties.</li>
      <li>As part of the <strong>Player Information</strong> properties, select a <strong>Player Type</strong> of <strong>Playlist</strong>. Click  <span class="button-blue"> Save </span>.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Styling</strong> in the left navigation menu.</li>
      <li>Select a <strong>Playlist Type</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Playlist (Vertical)</strong> - Playlist displays on the right side of the player.
            <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/publish/node15473-v-playlist-example.png" /></figure>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Playlist (Horizontal)</strong> - Playlist displays on the bottom of the player.
            <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/publish/node15473-h-playlist-example.png" /></figure>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Playlist (Hidden)</strong> - Playlist is not displayed.
            <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/publish/node15473-hidden-playlist-example.png" /></figure>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>When a <strong>Player Type</strong> of <strong>Playlist</strong> is selected as part of the <strong>Player Information</strong> properties, additional <strong>Playback</strong> properties can be configured:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Randomize play order</strong> - Videos will be played in a random order</li>
          <li><strong>Play video when selected</strong> - Clicking a thumbnail in the playlist menu will cause the video to play when loaded, even if the previous video in the player was paused</li>
          <li><strong>Continuous play mode</strong> - Videos will advance automatically and repeat indefinitely</li>
          <li><strong>Video Countdown</strong> - Only enabled when <strong>Continuous play mode</strong> is checked
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Up next card (auto advance)</strong> - An up next card is displayed in the player</li>
              <li><strong>Up next endscreen (countdown)</strong> - An end screen countdown is displayed in the player</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Click  <span class="button-blue"> Save </span>  to save changes. Remember to publish the player so the changes appear in the published player.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>When using the <strong>Standard (iframe)</strong> embed code, the playlist has a show/hide button and is automatically sized and positioned. When using the <strong>Advanced (in-page)</strong> embed code, you must insert the playlist as an HTML <code translate="No">&lt;div&gt;</code> element and write your own CSS to position and size the playlist. This gives you full control over the playlist's display. In the latter case, the playlist does not even need to be adjacent to the player if you don't want it to be. The <strong>Advanced (in-page embed) player</strong> section of the <a href="https://player.support.brightcove.com/general/implementing-playlists.html#Advanced_in_page_embed_player">Implementing Playlists</a>&nbsp;document has substantial content on formatting and styling a playlist.</p>
