    <p>When you publish a video using the Media module, the embed code contains the video ID of the video to publish. If you need to change the video that's published, the embed&nbsp;code will need to be changed. In some organizations, there may be a separation of work roles between the video producers responsible for creating and publishing content and the web developers responsible for maintaining the web pages. In this case, changes to web pages may take hours or days to complete. With a little upfront preparation, you can easily change the video in a player without making changes to the embed code. There are two ways to do this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#refid">Use a video reference ID</a></li>
      <li><a href="#pubplaylist">Use playlist player</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="refid">Using a video reference ID</h2>
    <p>A reference ID is a unique ID assigned by a publisher to a video. The reference ID is distinct from the video ID which is unique ID and generated by Video Cloud. Reference IDs are assigned to videos as part of the video properties and can be changed anytime.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: This technique may not be practical if your workflow already depends on using the reference ID for some other purpose, such as CMS integration.</aside>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Reference ID" src="/assets/images/publish/node16827-ref-id.png" /></figure>
    <p>Give your video a reference ID and then change your embed code so that it refers to the video by reference ID and not by video ID.</p>
    <p>The embed code would change from this:</p>
    <pre>
<code translate="No">&lt;iframe src="//players.brightcove.net/1486906377/default_default/index.html?<strong>videoId=5308260054001</strong>"   allowfullscreen  webkitallowfullscreen  mozallowfullscreen  width="640"  height="360"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>To this:</p>
    <pre>
<code translate="No">&lt;iframe src="//players.brightcove.net/1486906377/default_default/index.html?<strong>videoId=ref:frontpage</strong>"   allowfullscreen  webkitallowfullscreen  mozallowfullscreen  width="640"  height="360"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>Now, whenever you need to change the video in the player, remove the <strong>frontpage</strong> reference ID from the video and assign it to the new video you want to appear in the player.</p>

    <h2 id="pubplaylist">Using a playlist player</h2>
    <p>You can also easily change the video in a player by creating a and using a playlist.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Create a <strong>Manual</strong> playlist and call it <strong>frontpage</strong>.
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Create playlist" src="/assets/images/publish/node16827-playlist.png" /></figure>
      </li>
      <li>Add a single video to the playlist.
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Video in playlist" src="/assets/images/publish/node16827-video-in-playlist.png" /></figure>
      </li>
      <li>Publish the playlist.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Now, when the video needs to be changed, remove the existing video from the <strong>frontpage</strong> playlist and add the new video to the playlist.</p>
