    <p>To create a new player, follow these steps.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>Login to Video Cloud Studio.</li>
      <li>If you have multiple accounts, click the profile icon in the top right of the page and  select the account you would like to create the player in.

      </li>
      <li>Open the <strong>Players</strong> module.</li>
      <li>Click <span class="button-blue"><i class="button-icon" data-feather="plus"></i>Add player</span></li>
      <li>Enter a <strong> Name </strong>and <strong>Short Description</strong> for the player. For this Quick Start, the player name will be <strong>Sample Player</strong>.
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/publish/node14057-new-player-dialog.png" /></figure>
      </li>

        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/publish/node14057-list-of-players.png" /></figure>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>When a new player is created using the Players module, the player is built using the latest player version as published by Brightcove. To see the player version, open the Players module and click on the player that you want to check. The Player Information properties will display the <strong>Published Player Version</strong>.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/publish/node14057-player-version.png" /></figure>
    <p>Note that all players may not be the same version. As Brightcove continues to develop and improve the Brightcove player, new player versions will be released. By default, updates are applied to all players automatically. To prevent auto-updating of a player, you must set the <strong>Update Mode</strong> setting to <strong>Manual</strong> (also known as locking a player). For more information, see <a href="/players/setting-player-update-mode-and-version.html">Setting the Player Update Mode and Version</a>.</p>

To set the player dimensions, follow these steps.</p>

    <h2 id="style">Configuring styling properties</h2>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="social">Configuring social sharing properties</h2>
    <p>When social sharing is enabled, a share icon will appear at the bottom of the player next to the playhead. This will allow viewers to share your content out to popular social media sites. For more information on configuring the social properties for a player, see <a href="/players/configuring-social-properties-player.html">Configuring the Social Properties for a Player</a>.</p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="preview">Previewing the player</h2>
    <p>The preview player on the page should reflect the styling and social changes that have been made to the player.</p>

The color and social changes will not be pushed to the published player until the changes have been published inside of the Players module.</aside>
    <p>It is also possible to generate the publishing code for the preview player. For example, maybe the marketing department needs to approve all changes made to the player. You can send them a URL to the preview player so they can approve the changes. To generate the publishing code for the preview player, follow these steps.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>On the Players module homepage, click <strong>Embed Code &amp; URL</strong> and click <strong>Preview Player</strong>. The Preview Player Embed Code dialog will display.</li>
      <li>Click the <strong>Player URL</strong> to open the preview player in a new browser tab.</li>
      <li>The preview player should occupy the entire width of the browser page and have a Brightcove logo overlay indicating that it is the preview player. Confirm that the color changes and viral promotion changes are visible.</li>
      <li>Leave the preview player open and return to the Players module.</li>

      </li>
      <li>Return to the browser tab with the published player. Remember, the preview player will display a Brightcove logo overlay.</li>
      <li>Refresh the page and verify that the color change and viral promotion settings are now visible in the published player. Note that there might be a slight delay before the changes appear in the published player.</li>
