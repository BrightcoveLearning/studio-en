    <p>On most platforms, embedding videos directly into email isnâ€™t possible. This isn't a Brightcove limitation, nearly every modern email system will strip out video player embed code due to security reasons. You can however, drive awareness and traffic for content by creating an email with some teaser text and a poster image. The Media module provides the ability to publish a video to an email landing page.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: For another option on emailing videos that provides more control over the appearance of the video poster image and uses a custom landing page, see <a href="/publish/driving-video-views-through-email.html">Driving Video Views Through Email</a>.</aside>

    <p>To publish a video to an email landing page, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Open the Media module.</li>
      <li>Select a video.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Publish and Embed &gt; Email Landing Page</strong>.</li>
      <li>Select a landing page. The dropdown list will contain a <strong>Simple Landing Page</strong> which is a system provided, unstyled sample landing page. The list will also contain any published landing page experiences that were created using the Gallery module. Using a Gallery landing page provides more flexibility over the appearance and styling of the landing page. Lead forms can also be used to capture viewer information. For more information on creating Gallery landing pages, see <a href="https://gallery.support.brightcove.com/experiences/landing/creating-landing-page-experience.html">Creating a Landing Page Experience</a>.

      <li>(Optional) Click the <strong>Preview landing page</strong> link to preview the landing page.</li>
      <li>Highlight the image, copy it to the clipboard and then paste into an email message.</li>
