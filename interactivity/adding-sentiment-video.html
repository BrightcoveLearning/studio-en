    <p>HapYak Studio provides the ability to add different types of interactive overlays to videos. The User Sentiment widget can be used to gather viewer feedback on the helpfulness of  videos by letting viewers rate their experience. Reports are available to provide the aggregate feedback about the ratings that were submitted.</p>

    <h2 id="style">Widget styling options</h2>
    <p>The User Sentiment widget offers  three different styling options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Thumbs Up/Thumbs Down
        <figure class="bcls-figure"> <img src="/assets/images/interactivity/sentiment/thumbs.png"> </figure>
      </li>
      <li>Star Rating (out of 5)
        <figure class="bcls-figure"> <img src="/assets/images/interactivity/sentiment/stars.png"> </figure>
      </li>
      <li>Emoticons
        <figure class="bcls-figure"> <img src="/assets/images/interactivity/sentiment/emoticons.png"> </figure>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Notes on styling:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The widget can be positioned anywhere on the video</li>
      <li>The widget cannot be resized</li>
      <li>When the icon is clicked, it stays in the clicked/selected state for the remainder of the video</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="add">Adding a user sentiment widget</h2>
    <p>Typically, the User Sentiment widget is added to a <a href="using-templates.html">template</a> so that it can be easily added to multiple videos easily. Follow these steps to add a user sentiment widget to a template:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Login to HapYak Studio.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>NEW TEMPLATE</strong>.</li>
      <li>Enter a <strong>Title</strong> and click <strong>NEXT</strong>.
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img src="/assets/images/interactivity/sentiment/new-template.png"></figure>
      </li>
      <li>Confirm that the template is created. A sample video is automatically loaded into the template. To change the video, click <strong>Configure</strong> and enter a new <strong>Video Source</strong>.</li>
      <li>Click the widget icon in the bottom toolbar.
        <figure class="bcls-figure"> <img src="/assets/images/interactivity/sentiment/add-widget.png"> </figure>
      </li>
      <li>Click the <strong>User Sentiment</strong> widget.
        <figure class="bcls-figure"> <img src="/assets/images/interactivity/sentiment/user-sentiment-widget.png"> </figure>
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Note: Your group must be provisioned to have access to the User Sentiment widget.</aside>
      </li>
      <li>Click <strong>ADD</strong>. The widget is added on top of a sample video.</li>
      <li>Hover over the widget and click <strong>CONFIGURE</strong>.</li>
      <li>Enter a <strong>USER PROMPT</strong>. This is the text that will appear at the top of the widget.</li>
      <li>Select a <strong>TYPE</strong> of widget.</li>
      <li>Choose to display the <strong>COUNT SETTINGS</strong> (displayed only for Thumbs type). A threshold can be set for each count which will prevent the count from displaying until a certain number of likes/dislikes have been recorded.</li>
      <li>Set the icon, font and color settings as needed.</li>
      <li>The <strong>DISPLAY SETTINGS</strong> control how the widget appears during video playback.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Beginning</strong> - Controls how the widget will appear when the video starts playing</li>
          <li><strong>Middle</strong> - Controls how the widget will appear as the video is playing</li>
          <li><strong>End</strong> - Controls how the widget will appear at the end of the video</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following example would display the sentiment widget for 5 seconds when the video starts playing, then it would minimize and then expand for the last 5 seconds of the video.</p>
        <figure class="bcls-figure"> <img src="/assets/images/interactivity/sentiment/display-settings.png"> </figure>
      </li>
      <li>Click <strong>SAVE</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>A tag can be added to templates as a way to quickly add the User Sentiment widget  to Video Cloud videos that are published using a HapYak-enabled player. If a published video has the same tag that was assigned to the template, the User Sentiment widget will be displayed during video playback.</p>
    <p>Follow these steps to add a tag to the template.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>At the top of the page, click<strong> Configure</strong>.</li>
      <li>Locate the <strong>Tags</strong> field and click it.</li>
      <li>Add one or more <strong>Tags</strong>.
        This example  is using a tag of <code>sentiment</code>.
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img src="/assets/images/interactivity/sentiment/sentiment-tag.png"></figure>
      </li>
      <li>Click <strong>SAVE </strong> and then <strong>SUBMIT</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>By adding the tag <code>sentiment</code> to the template, any Video Cloud video that is tagged <code>sentiment</code> and published using a HapYak-enabled player will have the User Sentiment widget displayed during video playback.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Note: There may be a delay of up to one hour before the User Sentiment widget will appear in published Video Cloud videos.</aside>

    <h2 id="reports">Reviewing sentiment reports</h2>
    <p>The User Sentiment widget will collect a &quot;rating&quot; when the viewer clicks on their satisfaction emoji. Since there are three types of emojis which have been implemented (thumbs, stars and a smilies), each has its own rating map which is then normalized into a score from 1-5.</p>
    <p>The User Sentiment Summary report provides information on all projects with the User Sentiment widget. To access the report, follow these steps: </p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Login to HapYak Studio.</li>
      <li>In the left navigation, click <strong>Core Reports</strong>.</li>
      <li>Select a <strong>Date Range</strong> for the report.</li>
      <li>At the top of the page use the report selector to select the <strong>User Sentiment Summary</strong> report.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>RUN</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The report will display all projects with the User Sentiment widget.</p>
