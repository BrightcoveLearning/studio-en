    <h3>What is Interactive Video?</h3>
    <p>Interactive video is a video that works like the web. You can click and jump to a specific option, and it reacts to your actions, making it more engaging. Interactive video can be measured. In this way, you can have concrete evidence about the effectiveness and make informed decisions to improve. This is very helpful for businesses.</p>
    <h3>What are Annotations?</h3>
    <p>Annotations are anything you add to a video using HapYak; an overlay, a link, or a quiz. An annotation enhances the video and synchronized to it, so it looks like part of the video and shows up while you are watching.</p>
    <h3>What are Tracks?</h3>
    <p>The term <strong>track</strong> refers to a collection of annotations on a single video. Most users only have one track for a video, but in some cases, like branching or personalization, it is possible to have more than one.</p>
    <h3>What are Templates?</h3>
    <p>A template is a re-usable track that contains annotations you want to show up on dozens or hundreds of videos. Typically a template is used for common interactions, like a call-to-action that is not specific to one video.</p>
    <h3>What is a Project?</h3>
    <p>A HapYak project contains one video, the tracks for that video, and any unique configuration - like custom styles or languages settings.</p>
    <h3>What is an API?</h3>
    <p>An API is an Application Programming Interface. It's how different software talks to each other. HapYak has a complete set of APIs that users use to extend capabilities and integrate HapYak into their platforms.</p>
    <h3>Why do you call HapYak a Platform?</h3>
    <p>A platform is something you can build on top of. That's what HapYak is. HapYak provides a solid foundation of features, tools, and APIs out-of-the-box, but you users can extend and customize every detail to make something unique.</p>
