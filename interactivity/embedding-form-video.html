    <p>The Custom Form widget allows you to embed any form  from any system such as Google Forms, Typeform, Calendly, Eventbright and others  on top of a video. The Custom Form widget can also be used to display external web pages.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>This widget also cleverly hides the form and only slides it open when a viewer clicks a call to action.</p>
    <p>Using an external form (like a Google Form) with this annotation has the advantage of sending all the submitted data straight to that system. Note that no data submitted to the form will show up in the standard HapYak reports as it's routed directly to the external system.</p>
    <p>Think about setting the Start Time to 5 or 10 seconds (near the beginning) and setting the duration to "Until the end of the video". This will allow the viewer to click the CTA at any point in the video while keeping the form out of sight until the CTA is clicked.</p>

    <h2 id="configure-player">Before you get started</h2>
    <p>Before you can add HapYak interactivity to a player, you need a HapYak-enabled Brightcove Player and you need to make sure a HapYak project has been created. For information on how to do this, see <a href="getting-started-interactivity.html">Getting Started with Interactivity</a>.</p>

    <p>A tag can be added to templates as a way to quickly add the User Sentiment widget  to Video Cloud videos that are published using a HapYak-enabled player. If a published video has the same tag that was assigned to the template, the User Sentiment widget will be displayed during video playback.</p>

    <p>The User Sentiment widget will collect a &quot;rating&quot; when the viewer clicks on their satisfaction emoji. Since there are three types of emojis which have been implemented (thumbs, stars and a smilies), each has its own rating map which is then normalized into a score from 1-5.</p>
    <p>The User Sentiment Summary report provides information on all projects with the User Sentiment widget. To access the report, follow these steps: </p>
