    <p>There may be times when you want to replace the source file for a video. One common case is when you need to edit a video that was already published. If you delete the video and re-upload, you will have to re-enter all of the video metadata and you will lose any video analytics associated with the video.</p>
    <p>While the new renditions are being created, the video will remain playable using the existing renditions.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: You cannot replace the source file for videos that have been shared to your account.</aside>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Video file names (including the extension) must not exceed 120 single-byte (60 double-byte) characters. If it does, the video will be ingested successfully, but you will not be able to retranscode it later.</aside>

    <h2 id="steps">Steps to replace a video source file</h2>
    <p>To replace a video source file, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Click <i data-feather="video"></i> <strong>Media</strong>  in the navigation header to open the Media module.</li>
      <li>Click the link for the video you want to replace the source file for.</li>
      <li>Locate the <strong>Video Files</strong> section and click<strong> Replace Source File</strong>.</li>
      <li>The <strong>Upload</strong> module will open in another tab. Confirm that the Upload module indicates that you are replacing a source file.

      </li>
      <li>Select an ingest profile to use.
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Videos that were initially transcoded using a Dynamic Delivery or Context Aware ingest profile can only be retranscoded using one of those ingest profile types. Videos transcoded using a Legacy ingest profile can be retranscoded with any type of profile.</aside>
      </li>
      <li>Use the Upload module to upload a new source file. The new source file name does not have to match the original source file name. </li>
      <li>Check <strong>Keep existing thumbnail and poster images</strong> to keep the existing images. If you uncheck this box, new images will be generated based upon the image settings in the selected ingest profile.
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note that if you check the box, the existing images will be preserved - however, <strong>the image URLs will change</strong>.</aside>
      </li>
      <li>Any audio tracks associated with the original source file will be replaced by the new one.  Check <strong>Keep existing audio tracks</strong> to keep any separate audio tracks that were ingested.

      </li>
      <li>Click <strong>Process</strong> to begin the transcoding. A <strong>Processing Complete</strong> message will display. Note that there will be a delay before the updated renditions are available. Check the <strong>Upload Date</strong> values in the <strong>Video Files</strong> section of the Media module to verify that the new renditions are available.</li>
