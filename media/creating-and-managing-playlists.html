    <p>A playlist is a collection of videos that are grouped together in a particular order for playback in a player. The Media module makes it easy to create playlists and add videos to a playlist. After you've created your playlist, you can publish a playlist to a player. <span class="BCL-objective">For more information on publishing playlists, see <a href="/publish/publishing-videos-and-playlists-media-module.html">Publishing Videos and Playlists with the Media Module</a>.</span></p>
    <p><span class="BCL-objective">For more information about playlists, including best practices and tips for using them effectively, see <a href="/media/introduction-playlists.html">Introduction to Playlists</a>.</span></p>

    <h2 id="types">Types of playlists</h2>
    <p>There are two types of playlists:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Manual</strong> - With a manual playlist, you assign specific videos to the playlist and re-order them manually</li>
      <li><strong>Smart</strong> - With a smart playlist, the videos in the playlist are constructed automatically, based on video tags. Smart playlists are dynamic and automatically update based upon the videos in your media library and the rules that define the playlist.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A maximum of 1,000 videos can be added to a playlist (both Manual and Smart). There is no limit to the number of playlists that can be created. The videos that are initially loaded into a playlist in the player is determined by the type of playlist:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Manual Playlists</strong> - Videos are loaded into the playlist based upon the order of the videos in the  playlist</li>
      <li><strong>Smart Playlists</strong> - Videos are loaded into the playlist based upon the <strong>Play Order</strong> playlist setting</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For information on programmatically retrieving additional videos into a playlist, see the <a href="https://player.support.brightcove.com/code-samples/brightcove-player-sample-playback-api-paging.html">Playback API Paging</a> player sample.</p>

      <p>Smart playlists are created dynamically when the player is loaded from the available video information so the order should always reflect current state. However, the player always gets its info via the Playback API which uses data cached for up to 20 min. Playlists may take that long to refresh and may be behind what the <span translate="No">CMS API</span> would show.</p>
