  <h1>Adding Audio Tracks to Videos using the Media Module</h1>
  <summary>In this topic you will learn how to add audio tracks to videos using the Media module.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>Videos can be configured with multiple audio tracks. Multiple audio tracks can be used to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Play back the same video in different languages </li>
      <li>Provide audio with descriptions for the visually challenged</li>
      <li>Provide stereo vs. multi-channel (surround sound) audio</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Multiple audio tracks are supported for HLS V4+ and DASH - with and without DRM protection. Videos with multiple audio tracks will display a headphone icon (<img alt="" src="/assets/images/media/node18591-headphone-icon.png" />) in the controlbar. When the icon is clicked, the viewer can select between audio tracks.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Notes:
      <ul>
        <li>Multiple audio tracks can only be used with videos set up for <a href="/general/overview-dynamic-delivery.html">Dynamic Delivery</a>. In addition, your account must be enabled for multiple audio tracks. Contact your account manager for details.</li>
        <li>If audio tracks are added to a title after the video was originally ingested; the default ingest profile for the publisher's account is selected when processing the audio track. We recommend processing audio tracks with the same ingest profile as the original video title to ensure the same audio bitrate/renditions are used. For more details in setting the default ingest profile, please refer to <a href="/admin/managing-ingest-profiles.html#default">Managing Ingest Profiles</a>.</li>
        <li>When a video is uploaded using a Dynamic Delivery ingest profile, the source audio for the video will be transcoded according to the ingest profile and will appear in the <strong>Audio Tracks</strong> section for the video in the Media module. By default, the audio <strong>Language</strong> is set to <strong>English</strong> with a <strong>Variant</strong> type of <strong>main</strong>. The defaults can be changed by Brightcove Support. Additional audio tracks can then be added.</li>
        <li>When you add additional audio tracks to a video, they must all have the same bitrate/rendition profile to ensure successful playback in HLS (DASH playback will still work).</li>
        <li>When you add an audio track to a video, and then add a duplicate before the first one has finished uploading, one of the tracks may be corrupted, silently, <strong>causing playback of the video to fail</strong>. Be sure to wait until each track has fully uploaded before uploading another one.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2 id="audiotrack">Configuring the audio track properties</h2>
    <p>Audio track files can be uploaded and hosted by Brightcove or reside at an internet accessible URL. To view and edit the audio track properties for a video, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Open the Media module.</li>
      <li>Click the video title link and locate the <strong>Audio Tracks</strong> section. The audio track for the source video will appear.

      </li>
      <li>Click <strong>Edit</strong> or double-click in the section.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Add Audio Track</strong>.</li>
      <li>Select if the audio track file will be uploaded from the local file system or from an external URL.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>File Upload</strong> - Click <strong>Browse</strong> and select the audio track file from the local file system. The file will be uploaded to Video Cloud.</li>
          <li><strong>URL Upload</strong> - Enter the public URL where the audio track file resides and then click <strong>Upload</strong>. The file will be uploaded to Video Cloud.
            <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Audio track file names with parentheses, question marks, quotation marks, spaces and other special characters will silently fail when uploading. Brightcove recommends using file names without special characters.</aside>

      <li>The <strong>Language</strong> field should contain the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp">language code</a> that specifies the language of the track text data.</li>
      <li>Select the <strong>Variant</strong> of text track. The <strong>Variant</strong> describes the kind of audio track. Options include:
        <ul>
