    <p>Typically, videos are uploaded to Video Cloud using the Upload module. These files are then maintained by Brightcove. With remote assets, you maintain your video files on your own or a third-party system and then provide Video Cloud with the URL of the video file.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: The ability to create remote asset videos is available to Video Cloud Enterprise publishers. If you are interested in upgrading your Video Cloud account, please contact Brightcove for more information.</aside>
    <p>Remote asset videos can also be created using the Video Cloud CMS API. For information, see the <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/cms/managing-videos/using-cms-api-remote-assets.html">developer documentation</a>. Remote asset videos created using the <span translate="No">CMS API</span> can then be managed using the Media module.</p>

    <h2 id="access">Accessing remote assets</h2>
    <p>All of your remote asset files must be available at a public URL without any requirements for authentication or access control. If your remote assets are hosted by a CDN, the URL of the remote assets should be the URL of the assets in the CDN and not the URL on the origin server.</p>

    <h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You cannot use the image capture feature to create video still and thumbnail images for remote asset videos, however, video still and thumbnail images can be uploaded for remote asset videos</li>
      <li>Remote asset videos created in <strong>Basic</strong> accounts cannot be edited after they are created</li>
      <li>SSAI is not supported for remote assets</li>
      <li>DRM is supported only if you can customize the player to communicate with the DRM license server. This is possible with the Brightcove Player through a plugin. For other players, you will need to consult the player documentation.</li>
      <li>Analytics: the Brightcove Analytics system depends on system-generated video metadata, such as the video duration. Analytics data for remote assets will be less rich unless you can provide this metadata for the remote asset.</li>
      <li>Playback guarantee: all videos ingested into Video Cloud can be played back in the Brightcove Player. This is true for almost all remote assets, but there are some edge cases where videos may not play. There are a few advanced features of DASH and HLS that we do not yet support for example. For non-Brightcove players, you will need to verify that the video format is fully supported by that player.</li>
      <li>Viewers may not be able play remote asset videos if their computer's clock time is set ahead of the actual time</li>
      <li>Cue points cannot be added to live remote asset videos</li>
    </ul>
