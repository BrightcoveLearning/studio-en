    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>Closed captions can be added to videos to provide additional or interpretive information to individuals who wish to access it. Captions are necessary so the deaf and hard of hearing can access the audio portion of video presentations.</p>

    <p>Such text may be used for accessibility, to provide translations of the audio track or some other purpose, but the underlying technology used is the same.</p>

    <h2 id="filelocation">Captions file location</h2>
    
    <p>You can choose where to host the WebVTT captions file:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li><strong>At a Remote URL (remote asset)</strong> - In this case, the WebVTT file is hosted on your server and you add the URL for the file to the video metadata.
    
      <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: If you are hosting captions files on your own server, make sure the file is located at a URL that can be accessed by the Brightcove player. The server hosting the captions file should also have Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) enabled. You can read more about CORS <a href="https://general.support.brightcove.com/developer/concepts-cors.html">here</a>.</aside>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Uploaded using Video Cloud</strong> (<strong>ingested</strong>) - In this case, the WebVTT file is uploaded (ingested) to Video Cloud. This can be done using the Media module or using the APIs.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: If the video source file you ingest into Video Cloud has embedded 608/708 captions, they will be ignored during the processing of the video, and <strong>not</strong> present in the video renditions. To have captions with your videos, you will need to add them through the <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/media/adding-captions-videos-using-media-module.html">Media module</a>, the <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/dynamic-ingest/ingest-guides/ingesting-webvtt-files-text-trackscaptions.html">Dynamic Ingest API</a>, or the <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/cms/managing-videos/using-cms-api-add-webvtt-captions-text-tracks.html">CMS API (for remotely hosted captions)</a></aside>

    <section id="associate" class="bcls-section">
    <h2>Associating captions with a video</h2>
    
    <p>There are several ways to associate a captions file with a video:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Using Studio</li>
      <li>Modifying the player publishing code</li>
      <li>Using the APIs</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3 id="studio">Adding captions in Studio</h3>
    
    <p>Captions can be associated with a video using the Media module. For information, see <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/media/adding-captions-videos-using-media-module.html">Adding Captions to Videos using the Media Module</a>.</p>
    
    <h3 id="pubcode">Modifying the player publishing code</h3>
    
    <p>In this case, a <code>&lt;track&gt;</code> tag is added to the player publishing code. For more information, see <a href="https://player.support.brightcove.com/general/adding-captions-videos-programmatically.html">Adding Captions to Videos Programmatically</a>.</p>
    
    <h3 id="api">Adding captions via the APIs</h3>
    
    <p>How you add captions via the APIs varies depending on whether the captions file will be ingested or used as a remote asset.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p><strong>Remote asset captions</strong> - If you prefer to host the captions yourself (or have a captions provider who hosts them), then you can associate the captions with a video using the CMS API. For information, see <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/cms/managing-videos/using-cms-api-add-webvtt-captions-text-tracks.html">Using the CMS API: Add WebVTT Captions</a>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p><strong>Add captions to Video Cloud</strong> - If you want to have Brightcove host your captions, you can ingest your WebVTT file using the Dynamic Ingest API. For information, see <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/dynamic-ingest/ingest-guides/ingesting-webvtt-files-text-trackscaptions.html">Ingesting WebVTT Files</a>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Regardless of the method used to add caption files to a video, no more than 1000 text tracks may be added.</aside>

    <section id="remove" class="bcls-section">
    <h2>Removing captions</h2>
    
    <p>Captions can be removed from videos using the Media module or via the CMS API. In Studio, open the Media module and edit the video properties. Edit the <strong>Text Tracks</strong> property as needed.</p>
    
    <p>Captions can also be removed using the CMS API by making an <a href="https://docs.brightcove.com/cms-api/v1/doc/index.html#api-videoGroup-Update_Video">Update Video</a> request and submitting a request body with an empty <code>text_tracks</code> array (or an array from which the object associated with that set of captions has been removed).</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="styling" class="bcls-section">
    <h2>Styling captions</h2>
    
    <p>Styling can be applied to WebVTT captions using CSS. See <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/media/styling-captions.html">Styling Captions</a> for details.</p>
