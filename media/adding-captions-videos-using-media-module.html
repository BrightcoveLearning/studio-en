    <p>The text tracks properties can be configured to provide captions for a video. Captions provide additional or interpretive information to individuals who wish to access it. Captions are necessary so the deaf and hard of hearing can access the audio portion of video presentations. To display captions for a video in the Brightcove player, you need to complete the following tasks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#captionsfile">Create caption files</a></li>
      <li><a href="#texttrack">Configure the text track properties</a></li>

    <h2 id="captionsfile">Creating caption files</h2>
    <p>To add captions to a video, you first need to create a captions file. The Brightcove player supports Web Video Text Tracks Format (WebVTT), SRT and DFXP formats. The WebVTT file format (shown below) is plain text and contains time text data followed by the desired caption or subtitle text.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">
      <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>SRT and DFXP captions are not supported for videos using Legacy transcoding. SRT and DFXP captions will be automatically converted to WebVTT for Dynamic Delivery accounts.</li>
        <li>The text of the captions must be encoded UTF-8 to display properly for double-byte languages such as Japanese and Korean.</li>
        <li>Because the captions are displayed in HTML, any text inside <code translate="No">< ></code> brackets will be interpreted as a tag and not displayed.</li>

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Notes:
      <ul>
        <li>Caption file names should only include letters (upper or lower case), numbers, dashes (-) and underscores (_).</li>
        <li>
          We have seen cases where captions created by a third party start the captions with the time stamp:
          <p>01:00:00.000</p>
          <p>This will cause the captions to being <strong>one hour</strong> into the video. To ensure that the captions are correctly synced with the video, make sure that the time stamps begin with <strong>00:00:00.000</strong> and check all time stamps for the <strong>01</strong> hour offset.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      </aside>
    <p>For more information on the WebVTT format, see <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/webvtt/">this link</a>. You should have a separate caption file for each language you need to support. While there are many third-party tools to help create captions files, Brightcove has several partners that provide transcription, captioning and translation services.

    <h2 id="texttrack">Configuring the text track properties</h2>
    <p>Once the caption files have been created, they can be uploaded and hosted by Brightcove or reside at an internet accessible URL.</p>
    <p>To view and edit the text track properties for a video, open the Media module, click the video title link and locate the <strong>Text Tracks</strong> section. To configure the text track properties, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Click <strong>Edit</strong> or double-click in the section.</li>
      <li>Select if the text track file will be uploaded to Video Cloud or hosted on an external URL.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>File Upload</strong> - Click <strong>Browse</strong> and select the text track file from the file system. The file will be uploaded to Video Cloud.</li>
          <li><strong>URL Upload</strong> - Enter the public URL where the text track file resides and then click <strong>Upload</strong>. The file will be uploaded to Video Cloud.</li>
          <li><strong>Remote URL</strong> - Enter the public URL where the text track file resides. The URL must be less than 250 characters. Captions will be loaded from the remote URL.
            <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: If you are hosting captions files on your own server, make sure the file is located at a URL that can be accessed by the Brightcove player. The server hosting the captions file should also have Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) enabled. You can read more about CORS <a href="https://general.support.brightcove.com/developer/concepts-cors.html">here</a>.</aside>
            <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Text track file names with parentheses, question marks, quotation marks, spaces and other special characters will silently fail when uploading. Brightcove recommends using file names without special characters.</aside>
            <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Text track for videos shared to the account can't be edited in the Media module.</aside>

        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--warning language-editable">Note: The <strong>Default (Auto Display)</strong>&nbsp;option currently has no effect on Dynamic Delivery titles.</aside>
      </li>
      <li>The <strong>Language</strong> field should contain the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp">two-letter language code</a> that specifies the language of the track text data.</li>
      <li>Enter the appropriate <strong>Label</strong> for the caption file. The label is displayed inside player and allows the viewer to select a language. If no label is supplied, the language code is displayed.</li>
      <li>Select the <strong>Kind</strong> of text track. Options include:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Captions</strong> - Similar to subtitles, but may also include sound effects and other audio information</li>
          <li><strong>Subtitles</strong> - The transcription or translation of the dialogue</li>
          <li><strong>Descriptions</strong> - Intended to be a separate text file that describes the video through a screen reader</li>
          <li><strong>Chapters</strong> - Intended to help the user navigate through the video</li>
          <li><strong>Metadata</strong> - Information and content about the video which isn’t intended to be displayed to the viewer by default (though you may wish to do so using JavaScript)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Enter the <strong>MIME Type</strong> for the text track file. Selecting <strong>default</strong> will display the captions when the video is played (Brightcove Players 6.x and newer).

        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Note that if you are uploading SRT or DFXP captions, you will not be able to edit the MIME Type.</aside>
      </li>
      <li>Check <strong>Default (Auto Display)</strong> to make the track the default. Most browsers will attempt to display the default text track first but language and accessibility settings may override the default setting.
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: The default setting does not work with IE11.</aside>
      </li>
      <li>Click <strong>Add Text Track</strong> to save the text track information.

      </li>
      <li>Click <strong>Add Text Track</strong> to add another text track or<strong> Save</strong> to save the text tracks.
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Changes made to the text track properties may take up to 15 minutes to appear in published players.</aside>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>If any text tracks have been designated as the default, they will appear in <strong>bold</strong>. To delete a text track, click the delete icon (<img alt="" src="/assets/images/media/node15481-delete-icon.png" />) next to the text track.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note that the <code translate="No">default</code> value is not per track, but set to <code translate="No">true</code> for all tracks of the same language (<code translate="No">srclang</code>)</aside>
    <p>When a player with associated captions is published, a <strong>CC</strong> button will appear on the player chrome. Click the <strong>CC</strong> button to select a caption language and display the captions.</p>

    <h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Captions are supported on the following device types and operating systems.
      <ul>
        <li>iOS 10+</li>
        <li>Android 7+</li>
        <li>Internet Explorer 11+</li>
        <li>The latest Chrome, Safari, and Firefox browsers on desktops</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>There is no technical limit to the length of a caption, but in order for the full caption to be visible, the player must be large enough to display that much text</li>
    <li>Because Safari uses the native capabilities for styling captions, the <strong>Captions Settings</strong> menu option is not available in the the <strong>CC</strong> menu on Safari browsers (both iOS and macOS).</li>
    <li>If you ingest an invalid WebVTT file in Studio, the file will "process", but will not be added to the video. <strong>Workaround</strong>: you can validate your WebVTT files using <a href="https://quuz.org/webvtt/">this online validator</a>.</li>
