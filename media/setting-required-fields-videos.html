    <p>Many publishers use video metadata (names, tags, reference IDs, custom fields, etc.) as an essential tool to track and monetize their content. For video metadata to be effective, you need to make sure that each of the metadata fields you're depending on is actually present. The metadata assurance feature lets you designate which video metadata fields are important for your business purposes and then require users to complete the required metadata fields for new videos before the videos can become active.</p>

    <h2 id="designate">Designating metadata fields as required</h2>
    <p>Required video metadata fields are configured as part of the Video Cloud account settings. Both standard and custom metadata fields can be marked as required. To configure the required fields:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Open the  <strong>Admin</strong> module.</li>
      <li>Click the <strong>Video Fields</strong> link.</li>
      <li>Click on the field name you want to set as required.</li>
      <li>Check the <strong>Make this Field Required</strong> checkbox.</li>
      <li>Click <span class="button-blue"> Save Field</span> .</li>
    </ol>
    <p>At any time, you can uncheck the <strong>Make this Field Required</strong> checkbox for any field if you no longer want that field to be required. From that point on, Video Cloud will no longer check whether that field has been filled in.</p>
    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>Which metadata fields can be required fields?</h3>
      <p>The video name field is always required. Any custom metadata field can be a required field. In addition, the following standard metadata fields can be required:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Advertising</li>
        <li>Geo-Filtering On</li>
        <li>Short Description</li>
        <li>Long Description</li>
        <li>Reference ID</li>
        <li>Related Link Text</li>
        <li>Related Link URL</li>
        <li>Scheduling Start Date</li>
        <li>Scheduling End Date</li>
        <li>Tags</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

  <h2>Uploading with required metadata fields</h2>
  <p>Once you have specified required metadata fields for your account, users of your Video Cloud account will be prompted to complete required fields when they upload videos using the Media module. When you select a file to upload, it appears in the Upload Manager, with a Details pane that shows the required fields. Until you complete all the required fields, the <strong>Active</strong> checkbox for the video remains disabled and you will not be able to upload the video in an active state.  </p>
  <div class="BCL-subsection">
    <h3>Editing metadata in the Upload Manager Details pane</h3>
    <p>The Details pane shows all the required fields for your videos. You can edit the metadata for more than one video simultaneously by checking the boxes to the left of the names of the videos you are uploading. Note that Reference IDs must be unique, so you can't edit more than one video's Reference ID at a time. If a metadata field has a description, you can read the description in a tooltip linked to the <strong>i</strong> information icon next to the field's name.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="BCL-subsection">
    <h3>Uploading without required metadata</h3>
    <p>You can upload a video without its required metadata; however, if you do, it will be uploaded in an inactive state. An inactive video cannot be played back in a Video Cloud player. You can't activate an inactive video until all its required metadata has been supplied.</p>
  </div>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="missing">Videos without required metadata</h2>
    <p>If a video in your media library does not have all its required metadata, then:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If it's already active, it remains active and playable. This means that when you specify the required metadata fields for your account, your existing video library won't suddenly become unplayable until you update the required metadata.</li>
      <li>If it's already active and you edit it in the Media module, you cannot save your edits without supplying all required metadata in the section you're editing.</li>
      <li>If it is inactive, you cannot make it active without supplying all required metadata</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="uploading">Uploading videos without required metadata</h2>
    <p>By default, when a video is uploaded using the Upload module, the status of the video is set to <strong>Active</strong> unless required fields are missing. If required fields are missing, a message will be displayed with the required fields highlighted in red. Videos with missing required fields can still be uploaded but they will remain <strong>Inactive</strong> until all of the required fields have values.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="editing">Editing videos</h2>
    <p>If a video is inactive, you can freely edit and save its metadata in the Media module without supplying all required metadata. Also, the video can't be activated until all required metadata has been entered.</p>
    <p>If the video is already active, you cannot save any edits in the section you are editing unless you supply all required metadata in that section or deactivate the video.</p>

  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="activate">Activating videos</h2>
    <p>If you want to activate a video in the Media module, it must have all its required metadata. If you try to activate a video with missing required metadata, an error will appear.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Activate error" src="/assets/images/media/node15531-activate-error.png" /></figure>
    <p>The status bar at the bottom reports whether your videos can be activated. The Activate button remains disabled until you have supplied all the required metadata for the videos.</p>
    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>Workflow tip</h3>
      <p>Want to find all your inactive videos? In the Media module, you can sort all your videos by <strong>Status</strong>. Just click in the header on the <strong>Status</strong> column. Then, you can edit each of the inactive videos to see what required metadata they may be missing.</p>
      <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Sort by status" src="/assets/images/media/node15531-sort-by-status.png" /></figure>

  <!--<div class="BCL-concept" id="sharing">
  <h2>Required fields and media sharing</h2>
  <p>The Video&nbsp;Cloud <a href="node/1119">media sharing</a> feature enables sharing videos from one account (the sharer) to another (the sharee). This creates a copy of the shared video in the sharee account, including the video's metadata. If a shared video is missing fields that are required in the sharee account, the shared video will remain inactive until the required metadata is supplied. Read about <a href="node/7811">Using Metadata Assurance with Media Sharing</a>.</p>
</div>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
    <p>Required fields are enforced only in the Media module. You can't activate an inactive video in the Media module unless all of its required metadata fields are complete. However, a video without required metadata fields could still become active in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The video was created in your account and activated before you specified the required fields for your account</li>
      <li>The video was uploaded using the Dynamic Ingest API</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition, Video Cloud validates the type but does not validate the values of required metadata. As long as the value supplied has the correct type listed for the field in the Account Settings (for example, text, URL, or date), users can enter whatever values they choose.</p>
