    <p>The Upload module uses a dynamic ingest process to retrieve and transcode video content. When you select a file to upload, Video Cloud uses a pull-based process to pull the content from a storage location where it then uses the Zencoder transcoding service to transcode the content.</p>
    <p>To access the Upload module, open the  <strong>Upload</strong> module.</p>

    <h2 id="profile">Selecting an ingest profile</h2>
    <p>Before uploading videos, select an ingest profile. The ingest profile contains the transcode settings that will be used when the videos are transcoded. The list of available ingest profiles will vary based upon how your Video Cloud account is configured. In the following screen shot, both <strong translate="No">CONTEXT AWARE ENCODING</strong> and <strong translate="No">DYNAMIC DELIVERY</strong> profiles are available.</p>

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: To learn more about Dynamic Delivery, see <a href="/general/overview-dynamic-delivery.html">Overview of Dynamic Delivery</a>.</aside>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) profiles are also available as a paid add-on. To learn more about HEVC, see <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/ingest-profiles/guides/hevc-video.html">HEVC Video</a>.</aside>
    <p>The video renditions that are created are based upon the ingest profile that is selected. For specific details on the Brightcove supplied ingest profiles, see <a href="/admin/standard-ingest-profiles-dynamic-delivery-and-context-aware-encoding.html">Standard Ingest Profiles for Dynamic Delivery and Context Aware Encoding</a></p>
    <p>The image dimensions for the poster and thumbnail images are based upon the image dimensions specified in the ingest profile.</p>

    <h3 id="mp4">Do I need MP4 renditions?</h3>
    <p>There are several reasons why you might want to choose an ingest profile that creates MP4 renditions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sharing using the Social module</strong> - The Social module  requires that an MP4 rendition be available to share to social media. An MP4 rendition is also required to download a video using the Social module.</li>
      <li><strong>Downloading videos</strong> - If viewers will have the ability to <a href="downloading-videos-video-cloud.html">download videos</a> using a  download link on a webpage, download from a <a href="https://gallery.support.brightcove.com/experiences/portal/downloading-videos-portal-experience.html">Gallery Portal</a> or <a href="https://gallery.support.brightcove.com/experiences/inpage/configuring-video-downloads-page-experience.html">In-Page experience</a> or download by using an RSS feed, you should create MP4 renditions.</li>
      <li><strong>Closed captions</strong> - (CEA 608/708) closed captions for accessibility <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/dynamic-ingest/ingest-guides/ingesting-webvtt-files-text-trackscaptions.html">can only be added</a> to MP4 renditions. You  can <a href="adding-captions-videos-using-media-module.html">add text track captions</a> to HLS/DASH renditions but these do not meet legal accessibility standards.</li>
      <li><strong>Cloud Playout module</strong> - In order to be <a href="/cloud-playout/cloud-playout-add-content.html">added to  Cloud Playout channels</a>, videos must have at least one MP4 rendition.</li>
      <li><strong>Streaming to Legacy Devices</strong> - Older devices such as Android 4.x and prior require MP4 renditions for streaming via progressive download.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If any of these use cases are important to you, Brightcove recommends selecting an ingest profile that generates one or more MP4 renditions.</p>

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Before uploading videos, make sure the appropriate ingest profile has been selected.</aside>
    <p>Videos can be uploaded using one of these methods:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Drag and Drop</strong> - Drag files from the file system to the Upload module page. The entire page below the navigation header becomes the drop zone. When the file is dropped, the upload process will begin.

    </ul>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Notes:
      <ul>
        <li>There is no file size limit. Brightcove has tested with uploads as large as 100GB without any issues.</li>
        <li>When uploading large files, Brightcove recommends setting the <a href="/admin/managing-account-settings.html#upload">Upload Queueing</a> setting to <strong>Upload one file at a time</strong>.</li>
        <li>If you receive Studio timeout errors when uploading large files, try uploading the file to S3 or some other remote storage location and use the URL upload option in the Studio.</li>
        <li>YouTube URLs cannot be used as they do not generate direct links to video files.</li>
        <li>For information on uploading files from Google Drive, see <a href="/media/uploading-videos-remote-urls.html">Uploading Videos Using Remote URLs</a>.</li>
        <li>The URL must <strong>not</strong> contain spaces. If there are any spaces in the path or file name, rename any folders or files, replacing the spaces with underscore characters (<code translate="no">_</code>)</code>.</li>
        <li>The URL to the file may end with <code translate="No">?dl=0</code>. To force the browser to download the contents of the link, you must change that part of the URL to <code translate="No">?dl=1</code>.</li>
        <li>Video file names (including the extension) must not exceed 120 single-byte (60 double-byte) characters. If it does, the video will be ingested successfully, but you will not be able to retranscode it later.</li>
      </ul>
    </aside>
    <p>Once the files have been selected, the file upload will begin. To cancel the upload, click <span class="button-blue">Cancel Upload</span>.    Click <span class="button-blue">Dismiss</span> to remove the file entry from the page. <strong>While uploads are in a processing state, do not close or move away from the browser window.</strong> Doing so may cause an incomplete upload.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/media/node14456-video-processing.png" /></figure>
    <p>When the upload is complete, a <strong>Processing Complete</strong> status will display. This indicates the processing has completed and it is safe to navigate from the Upload module.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/media/node14456-video-processing-complete.png" /></figure>
    <p>Click <span class="button-blue">Edit</span>  to view the ingest profile and a subset of the video properties. The ingest profile can be changed if the video transcoding has not started. The following video properties can be edited:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Status</strong> - Video status
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Active</strong> - Video can be played</li>
          <li><strong>Inactive</strong> - Video can't be played</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By default, when a video is uploaded, the status is set to Active unless required fields are missing. If required fields are missing, a message will be displayed with the required fields highlighted in red. Videos with missing required fields can still be uploaded but they will remain Inactive until all of the required fields have values. For more information on working with required fields, see <a href="/media/setting-required-fields-videos.html">Setting Required Fields for Videos</a>.</p>
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: There is an account level setting, <strong>Default to Inactive</strong>, which can be used to set all uploaded videos to be inactive.

      <li><strong>Enable offline playback</strong> - When checked, enables the video to be saved locally and viewed offline when using applications created using the device SDKs. This option will only appear if the account is enabled for offline playback. It is recommended to only set this option when using <a href="/admin/managing-account-settings.html#upload">Advanced upload</a> (when user must manually start upload processing). Setting this when a video is in the process of uploading may cause issues.</li>
      <li><strong>Move to Folder</strong> - Select a folder to assign the video to. For more information on working with folders, see <a href="/media/organizing-videos-using-folders.html">Organizing Videos Using Folders</a>.</li>
