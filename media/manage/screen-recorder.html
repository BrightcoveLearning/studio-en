    <h2 id="audit">Created and updated date and time information</h2>
    <p>The user ID of the user who created and/or updated the video will be displayed in the Created Date/Updated Date columns. If the action was taken via the CMS API, <strong>Updated by API</strong> will be displayed. Note that if a user who performed an action is removed from an account, their ID will still appear.</p>
    <p>There are cases where changes made to a video will not record a user ID and cases where a user ID may not be displayed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When a video is retranscoded or if the video source is replaced, the updated date for the video will be updated but the user who initiated the action will not be recorded</li>
      <li>When the images (poster/thumbnail) and/or text tracks are updated, the updated date for the video will be updated but the user who initiated the action will not be recorded</li>
      <li>When a video is shared to an affiliate account, the created date will not display an associated user ID</li>
      <li>When a video clip is created using the Social or Live modules, the created date will not display an associated user ID</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This feature was enabled on December 7, 2018. Any videos uploaded or edited after this date will display user information.</p>
