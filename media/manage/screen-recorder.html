    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">When you stop recording, a video file of your recording will automatically be downloaded to your computer. The format and encoding of this file are chosen depending on your browser and its version. </aside>
    <!-- <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Brightcove recommends keeping the tab with the recorder open while screen sharing in a separate window or monitor to ensure everything is captured appropriately.</aside> -->
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Currently, video output depends on the browser you use to record. Downloaded videos may not work as expected due to how the browser records them.</aside>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Brightcove can guarantee it will upload and encode through Video Cloud, but Brightcove can't guarantee that it will play locally or through other video players or apps. If you need an offline file, you can download it from your Video Cloud account.

      <h2>What's the difference between microphone, tab, and system audio?</h2>
      <p><strong>Microphone audio</strong> is the sound your computer's built-in microphone (or any external microphone you're using) captures during the recording.</p>
      <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip language-editable">Only record your voice with microphone audio. If you try to record the sound coming from your computer's speakers with your microphone, the quality will be very low.</aside>
      <p><strong>Tab audio</strong> is any sound from within your browser that plays on your computer's speakers. For example, if you play a video on YouTube, the sound coming from the video is tab audio. Tab audio is only available when you record your browser tab.</p>
      <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip language-editable">We recommend using headphones if you want to record tab audio AND narrate over your recording. If you don't use headphones, your microphone may pick up the tab audio from your computer's speakers and distort the sound.</aside>
      <p><strong>System audio</strong> is the same as tab audio, except it refers to all the audio originating from any of your computer's programs (not just a browser tab).</p>
