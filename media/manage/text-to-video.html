        <p>When users use other AI tools, like MidJourney for synthetic images or Runway for 4-second synthetic videos, how they submit the prompt has an impact. It's like a new skill that creators need to have. Without that prompt, the AI tool will give them an asset that does not fit the purpose.</p>
        <p>The same applies to Video Cloud, AI, and Enterprise use cases. If Video Cloud users add a prompt in Wochit AI that says, 'Make me a video of a dolphin wearing a Santa hat,' it will not work because Wochit does not produce synthetic video and will have to search for those images or clips in licensed content libraries. So, the result will be a generic, simple video that lacks storytelling skills to captivate the audience.</p>

            This Wochit feature will be enabled for Customers at their election, who will receive access to Brightcove-created web-based documents that outline best practices/limitations provided by Wochit, including:
            <ul>
                <li>A prompt contains the entire script for the intended video, up to 450,000 characters per prompt, or 83,000 words. Prompts should include any descriptions of the types of music that should apply to the resulting video.</li>
                <li>The more superficial the prompt, the better.</li>
                <li>Using a URL (or multiple URLs) for an article, product, marketing page, etc. A user can create use conditions: use the article from this URL and these stats from this other URL.</li>
                <li>Only copy and paste functionality is available (documents are not imported in other formats, like PDFs or Google Docs).</li>
                <li>A disclaimer about copyrightable output may be needed.</li>

      <h2 id="why-how">Why AI & How it Works</h2>
      <details><summary>Does Wochit AI produce a synthetic video?</summary>
       No. So, what does that mean?
       <ul>
        <li>Synthetic video means that AI has generated footage for a location, person, animal, or flower…that does not exist.</li>
        <li>Instead, Wochit creates those videos using existing footage from a list of libraries (editorial and creative).</li>
      </ul>
     </details>
       <details><summary>Does it work if we feed it Google Docs instead of articles from a website?</summary>
        Yes and No.
        <ul>
         <li>"No" because it is not currently integrated; there are complexities around file sharing and making it publicly available, leading to an extensive process.</li>
         <li>"Yes" because if you have a Google Doc, it is probably easiest to copy and paste its content as if it were a script.</li>
       </ul></details>
       <details><summary>What about style/colors?</summary>
       <ul>
        <li>The assets will be generated by default using the style defined in the corresponding Wochit account. There is no need to specify colors or fonts in the prompts.</li>
           <ul>
            <li>Brightcove has one umbrella account for all the customers. This Brightcove account in Wochit has a generic style applied. All the AI-generated assets from our customers under that account will use the same style.</li>
            <li>Through professional services, we can have customers under their own account, e.g., Sotheby's. In this way, Sotheby's AI-generated videos would have their own style applied automatically.</li>
           </ul>
        <li>Wochit Frame and Wochit Studio have different graphic packages that support AI. If you see weird inconsistencies, check that your account has the right graphic package.</li>
       </ul>

      <h2 id="tracking-limitations">Best practices and recommendations</h2>
      <details><summary>What is the best prompt?</summary>
          <ul>
            <li>A full script if you have one.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The script can be thousands of characters long.</li>
                <li>What happens if it is so long that it reaches the limit?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>AI will first summarize it to ensure nothing is left out and then create the video from the summary.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
          </ul>
      </details>
       <details><summary>Why is the script the best?</summary>
          <ul>
            <li>Many enterprises work with agencies that help them with content ideas, or they have someone internally who helps with scripts for the CEO or team members who can write their own scripts and get them approved.</li>
            <li>New tools, such as ChatGPT, are being used for research, outlines, and/or script generation. Nowadays, you can quickly test a script by making a video for it or test another version of the script (e.g., generated with ChatGPT with more humor) by clicking a couple of buttons.</li>
          </ul>
        </details>
        <details><summary>What else works great?</summary>
        <ul>
            <li>Using one or multiple URLs for an article, product, or marketing page. For example: "Use the article from this URL and these statistics from this other URL.".</li>

      <h2 id="good-prompt">What is then a good prompt?</h2>
      <p>Let's run an example with this prompt:</p>
      <p><strong>“Summarize the article from this URL into a video. Add ten scenes. Each scene must have a background video. Add one text overlay per scene to summarize the scene. One of the overlays should be a word-by-word quote from the article. In one of the scenes, put an overlay with statistics. Highlight essential words and phrases by surrounding them with double asterisks (**). The music for the video needs to represent happiness and summer. <a href="https://www.brightcove.com/en/resources/blog/5-types-video-marketing/">5 Types of Marketing Videos Throughout the Buyer Journey</a>”</strong></p>
      <p>With Brightcove's AI, simple is better, but there are some things we can tune. For example:</p>    
      <ol>
        <li><strong><i>Summarize the article from this URL into a video.</i></strong> — Mainly to summarize, there is no need to go in this direction. The engine is tuned to create short-form videos. Instead, write, “Create a video for this article: {URL}.”</li>
        <li><strong><i>Add ten scenes.</i></strong> — This is also not needed. The engine will create as many scenes as needed. Forcing it to a finite number is doable but not ideal.</li>
        <li><strong><i>Each scene must have a background video.</i></strong> — It is unnecessary. In any event, the engine will try to match a media element to every scene, favoring videos over images. Also, you have no control over whether this will be a video or image, so this just adds clutter.</li>
        <li><strong><i>Add one text overlay per scene to summarize the scene.</i></strong> - It is unnecessary; for the same reason, the engine starts by building a script and breaking it into scenes. Each scene's text will be seeded on the scene with the appropriate overlay type.</li>
        <li><strong><i>One of the overlays should be a word-by-word quote from the article.</i></strong> - This is good; however, it could be better phrased as “One of the scenes should be a word-by-word quote from the article.”</li>
        <li><strong><i>In one of the scenes, put an overlay with statistics.</i></strong> - Also good. Again, I'd phrase it as “One of the scenes should include some statistics from the article”.</li>
        <li><strong><i>Highlight essential words and phrases by surrounding them with double asterisks (**).</i></strong> - Good.</li>
        <li><strong><i>The music for the video needs to represent happiness and summer.</i></strong> - It is unnecessary and cannot be dictated through the prompt anyway. The engine automatically selects a suitable track.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Below, your prompt should have looked like these two options:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
            <p>== Just the URL===</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.brightcove.com/en/resources/blog/5-types-video-marketing/">5 Types of Marketing Videos Throughout the Buyer Journey</a></p>
        </li>
        <li><p>== URL + details ===</p></li>
        <p>“Create a video about this article:
            <a href="https://www.brightcove.com/en/resources/blog/5-types-video-marketing/">5 Types of Marketing Videos Throughout the Buyer Journey</a>. 
            Highlight important words and phrases by surrounding them with double asterisks (**).
            One of the scenes should be a word by word quote from the article.
            One of the scenes should include some stats from the article.”.</p>
      </ol>
      <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Notes:
        <ul>
            <li>The video produced may not be perfect, but it will be a good starting point.</li>
            <li>The article includes no statistics; hence, the engine did not follow our request for a statistics scene.</li>
            <li>These types of articles are probably the hardest to turn into a video. To simplify, imagine any article you would want to turn into a video and whether it would be difficult for a human to articulate the story in visuals. If the answer is that the story is abstract and harder for a human to create, so will it be for AI.</li>
