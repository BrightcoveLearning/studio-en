        <p>When users use other AI tools, like MidJourney for synthetic images or Runway for 4-second synthetic videos, how they submit the prompt has an impact. It's like a new skill that creators need to have. Without that prompt, the AI tool will give them an asset that does not fit the purpose.</p>
        <p>The same applies to Video Cloud, AI, and Enterprise use cases. If Video Cloud users add a prompt in Wochit AI that says, 'Make me a video of a dolphin wearing a Santa hat,' it will not work because Wochit does not produce synthetic video and will have to search for those images or clips in licensed content libraries. So, the result will be a generic, simple video that lacks storytelling skills to captivate the audience.</p>

      <h2 id="why-how">Why AI & How it Works</h2>
      <details><summary>Does Wochit AI produce a synthetic video?</summary>
       No. So, what does that mean?
       <ul>
        <li>Synthetic video means that AI has generated footage for a location, person, animal, or flower…that does not exist.</li>
        <li>Instead, Wochit creates those videos using existing footage from a list of libraries (editorial and creative).</li>
      </ul>
     </details>
       <details><summary>Does it work if we feed it Google Docs instead of articles from a website?</summary>
        Yes and No.
        <ul>
         <li>"No" because it is not currently integrated; there are complexities around file sharing and making it publicly available, leading to an extensive process.</li>
         <li>"Yes" because if you have a Google Doc, it is probably easiest to copy and paste its content as if it were a script.</li>
       </ul></details>
       <details><summary>What about style/colors?</summary>
       <ul>
        <li>The assets will be generated by default using the style defined in the corresponding Wochit account. There is no need to specify colors or fonts in the prompts.</li>
           <ul>
            <li>Brightcove has one umbrella account for all the customers. This Brightcove account in Wochit has a generic style applied. All the AI-generated assets from our customers under that account will use the same style.</li>
            <li>Through professional services, we can have customers under their own account, e.g., Sotheby's. In this way, Sotheby's AI-generated videos would have their own style applied automatically.</li>
           </ul>
        <li>Wochit Frame and Wochit Studio have different graphic packages that support AI. If you see weird inconsistencies, check that your account has the right graphic package.</li>
       </ul>

      <h2 id="tracking-limitations">Best practices and recommendations</h2>
      <details><summary>What is the best prompt?</summary>
          <ul>
            <li>A full script if you have one.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The script can be thousands of characters long.</li>
                <li>What happens if it is so long that it reaches the limit?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>AI will first summarize it to ensure nothing is left out and then create the video from the summary.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
          </ul>
      </details>
       <details><summary>Why is the script the best?</summary>
          <ul>
            <li>Many enterprises work with agencies that help them with content ideas, or they have someone internally who helps with scripts for the CEO or team members who can write their own scripts and get them approved.</li>
            <li>New tools, such as ChatGPT, are being used for research, outlines, and/or script generation. Nowadays, you can quickly test a script by making a video for it or test another version of the script (e.g., generated with ChatGPT with more humor) by clicking a couple of buttons.</li>
          </ul>
        </details>
        <details><summary>What else works great?</summary>
        <ul>
            <li>Using one or multiple URLs for an article, product, or marketing page. For example: "Use the article from this URL and these statistics from this other URL.".</li>
        </ul>

      <details><summary>Which embed code should I use? Iframe or in-page?</summary>
       For Campaign to work, it is required that the Advanced embed code is used.  If the Standard (iframe) embed code is used, then the player is isolated from the page, which means the Campaign plugin cannot see the unique identifier, and thus, all users will be seen as “unknown”.</details>
       <details><summary>What is marketing automation?</summary>
       Marketing automation is a technology that tracks lead/user interaction with different online marketing channels (email, web, forms, content, video, social, etc.). Marketing automation helps marketers market more effectively across these channels and automates repetitive marketing tasks (such as email communications). Marketing automation allows the marketer to set up automated and personalized tasks based on predefined variables. 
          For example, if a user watches 75% of a specific video, send them an email on that specific subject, but if they only watch 12%, send them something else. </details>
        <details><summary>Is Brightcove a marketing automation company?</summary>

        <details><summary> How can I check to see if a Marketo custom activity is set up correctly?</summary>
        Campaign has a hidden URL which offers some debugging tools for certain kinds of integrations, Marketo REST being one. <a href="https://studio.brightcove.com/products/videocloud/campaign/debug">https://studio.brightcove.com/products/videocloud/campaign/debug</a>
          <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Campaign settings " src="/assets/images/s-campaign-img/general/faq-debug.png" /></figure> </details>
          <details><summary>What needs to be done to configure a custom integration?</summary>
        Three things need to be done:
          <ol>
            <li>You need to expose a unique identifier in the URL or code of the page that Campaign can capture.</li>
            <li> Create a script that makes use of the Audience API's to retrieve the data as a JSON file (Brightcove Global Services can help with this).</li>
            <li> Map the data to fields  in your destination database (think spreadsheet merge).</li>
          </ol>
          The following support documentation covers these tasks:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="/campaign/integrations/non-map/creating-custom-integrations-campaign-module.html">Creating Custom Integrations with the Campaign Module</a> - Covers how to provide a unique identifier that Campaign can capture</li>
            <li> <a href="/campaign/develop/overview-audience-api.html">Audience API</a> -  Covers how to programmatically retrieve all the data as a JSON file which you can then import into your data processing system of choice</li>
          </ul>
          </details>
          <details><summary>How does Campaign push CDO data to Eloqua?</summary>
        We use the custom object bulk API. <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/marketingcs_gs/OMCAC/api-bulk-2.0-customobjects.html">https://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/marketingcs_gs/OMCAC/api-bulk-2.0-customobjects.html </a></details>
        <details><summary>How does Campaign push the external asset activity? How can I control the Campaign, External Asset, and Activity Types used?</summary>
        We using the external activity API (<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/marketingcs_gs/OMCAC/op-api-rest-2.0-data-activity-post.html">https://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/marketingcs_gs/OMCAC/op-api-rest-2.0-data-activity-post.html</a>). There's no control over the name of the campaign, asset name or type. We simply create a campaign on our own (named BrightcoveVideoPlay) and then proceed to create activities, also named BrightcoveVideoPlay. </details>
        <details><summary>What IP addresses can I whitelist so that Campaign can talk to service X?</summary>
        Campaign has established a set of IP addresses that should be used for IP whitelisting. To see the list, edit an Eloqua connection and click the <a ng-click="showInfo()" ng-if="::!ctrl.hideWhitelistInfo && ctrl.isEloqua(ctrl.integration)" context="troubleSeeing"><strong>Unable to see Campaign data in Eloqua?</strong></a> link to see the list of IP addresses.</details>
