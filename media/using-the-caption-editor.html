    <p>Captions can be added to videos and provide additional or interpretive information to individuals who wish to access it. Captions are associated with videos as part of the <strong>Text Track</strong> properties. Video Cloud provides the ability to <a href="generating-captions-videos.html">auto-generate captions</a> for a video or captions can be <a href="adding-captions-videos-using-media-module.html">manually associated</a> with videos. </p>
    <p>Once captions have been added to videos, the caption editor can be used to edit the caption files.The text tracks properties can be configured to provide captions for a video. </p>

    <h2 id="auto-caption">Generating captions</h2>
    <p>The caption editor can be used to generate captions for a video. To generate captions for a video, follow these steps.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Open the caption editor.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Auto caption</strong>.</li>
      <li>Select the <strong>Language</strong> to generate the captions in. If a <strong>Language</strong> is not selected, the video language is auto-detected. Selecting a language will improve the caption file generation time and may improve overall accuracy.</li>
      <li>Enter a <strong>Label</strong>. The label is typically set to the language used in the video. The label will be displayed in the CC dropdown in the video player and will be used by viewers to select the captions to be displayed.
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/media/capedit-caption-settings.png" /></figure>
      </li>
      <li>Click <strong>Done</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The page will need to be refreshed when the captions are complete for them to populate in the caption editor. The generated captions will have a <strong>Published</strong> status after they are generated.</p>

    <h2 id="issues">Known issues and feature gaps</h2>
    <p>Because the caption Eeitor is not yet a finished feature, there are some known issues/feature gaps that you may want to be aware of. These are listed below and will be resolved in the coming weeks. </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Publish and Unsave workflow</strong> - We recognize that it is not ideal to have to publish a text track and then unpublish separately to hide the captions from end viewers. We are working on making this a single action.</li>
      <li><strong>Overlapping captions</strong> - If one caption has a start time with the same timecode as the previous captionâ€™s end time, they will appear to overlap in the caption player. It will not appear that way to end viewers - the caption line with the same start timecode will win the conflict.</li>
      <li><strong>Timecode errors</strong> - Only numbers and colons are allowed in the timecode field. If you enter in any other character-types (e.g. letters, commas), it will result in an error. To fix this, replace the disallowed characters with a number or colon. </li>
      <li><strong>Analytics panel</strong> - The Video Views panel in the video details page may be removed once the caption editor is turned on. This will also impact the position of the panels. We are working on fixing this. </li>
