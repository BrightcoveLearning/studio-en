      <p>The Trending Now report uses speculative windowing to calculate partially-completed value.  These aggregations emit a new minutely value every 1 minute and then a complete value at the end of the minute. Depending on the system load, the overwriting process may not be completed causing one minute outstanding spikes in the CCU reporting.</p>
