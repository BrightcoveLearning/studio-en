    <p>Analytics data is sent automatically by the Brightcove Players, including those provided by the Native Player SDKs. If you are <strong>not</strong> using a Brightcove Player to deliver Video Cloud videos, you need to instrument the player you are using to send the data to the Data Collector. See the <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/data-collection/overview-data-collection-api-v2.html">Overview: Data Collection API</a> topic for more details.</p>
    <p>To view the Performance report, open the Analytics module and select <span class="BCL_command"><strong>Performance</strong></span> from the left side navigation. The report will display a graph showing total video views per day for the time period selected. The dropdown list can be used to select another metric:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Video Views</strong> - The number of times a video started playing, recorded when the stream is started (does not include rewind or replay); it is not a measure of individual viewers; for videos with pre-roll ads, a view is not recorded until the video starts to play</li>
      <li><strong>Video Impressions</strong> - Number of times a video was loaded and ready for interaction</li>
      <li><strong>Play Requests</strong> - The number of times playback was requested either by a user pressing the play button or an auto-play event</li>
      <li><strong>Play Rate</strong> - The percentage of videos that were loaded that were actually played (video views / video impressions)</li>
      <li><strong>Viewed Minutes</strong> - Number of minutes the video was watched</li>
      <li><strong>Engagement Score</strong> - The average percent watched per video view (calculated by adding all the percentage watched divided by the number of video views)</li>
      <li><strong>Daily Unique Viewers</strong> - Calculated using the IP address and user agent of viewers. Brightcove made the decision not to use a 3rd party cookie because cookies are increasingly being blocked by browsers. Daily Unique Viewers is available at the account or video level; this metric is not available when filtering by a video (or anything else). Brightcove also provides the ability to base unique viewers on the value you provide instead of their IP address. For more information, see the <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/data-collection/overview-data-collection-api-v2.html#uniqueuser">Analytics Event Tracking</a> developer document.</li>
      <li><strong>Video Bandwidth</strong> - Includes bandwidth for videos only. Note that bandwidth data is delayed by 3-5 days.</li>
      <li><strong>Total Bandwidth</strong> - Includes bandwidth for videos, images and player loads. Note that bandwidth data is delayed by 3-5 days.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By default, the report will display performance data for all stream types. If your account is enabled for Brightcove Live, you can choose to view performance data  for all videos, VOD assets or live assets. Click the <strong>Stream type</strong> pill to make a selection.</p>

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Notes:
      <ul>
        <li>The Analytics reports do include analytics for videos that have been deleted from your account. You cannot search for deleted videos in the Analytics module to see a report on a particular deleted video. To get such a report, you will need to know the video ID for the deleted video and use the <a href="https://docs.brightcove.com/analytics-api/v1/doc/index.html">Analytics API</a> to generate the report.</li>
        <li>It takes up to 3 days for data on Daily Unique Viewers and Video Bandwidth data to be available.</li>
        <li>A video view is not the same as the Views at x% in the Engagement Report. A video view is counted when a video first starts playing back. The views at 1% is recorded when the first percent is watched. The difference here is that if the first percent is watched multiple times (if the video is set to auto-replay, for instance), the count increases, whereas a video view is counted when the video first starts playing back but is not counted on a replay (unless the user reloads the page or watches another video in the playlist, etc).</li>
        <li>Simultaneous report requests within the same account will execute in series. If the reports have large date ranges and many fields are selected, there may be a delay before all the results are returned. A good alternative is to schedule large reports.</li>
        <li>With <a href="https://gallery.support.brightcove.com/experiences/inpage/overview-creating-editing-and-publishing-page-experiences.html">In-Page experiences</a>, even though the video(s) appear to be loaded into a player, videos aren't loaded until the viewer clicks the play button overlay. Therefore, video impressions will not be recorded by the Analytics module until a viewer plays a video.</li>
      </ul>
    </aside>
    <p>The report switcher below the chart can be used to quickly switch to another report.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="report switcher" src="/assets/images/analytics/node10104-report-switcher.png" /></figure>
    <p>The dropdown list to the right of the report switcher can be used to select a report dimension. The following dimensions are available with the Performance Report:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#video">Video</a></li>
      <li><a href="#player">Player</a></li>
      <li><a href="#traffic">Source of Traffic</a></li>
      <li><a href="#domain">Display Domain</a></li>
      <li><a href="#country">Country</a></li>
      <li><a href="#device">Device</a></li>
      <li><a href="#devicetype">Device Type</a></li>
      <li><a href="#deviceos">Device OS</a></li>
      <li><a href="#deviceman">Device Manufacturer</a></li>
      <li><a href="#browser">Browser Type</a></li>
      <li><a href="#day">Day</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that the available dimensions will change based upon the report that is selected. The bottom of the report has controls which let you select how many rows should be displayed and for navigating to other pages.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="compare">Compare to previous period</h2>
    <p>Selecting the <strong>Compare to previous period</strong> checkbox will add an overlay dashed line graph representing the data for the previous period.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Compare previous period" src="/assets/images/analytics/node10104-compare-previous.png" /></figure>
    <p>The previous period is based upon what is currently selected for the report date range. For example, if you select a date range of last 7 days, the previous period will be 2 weeks ago. When comparing trends over weeks, it is best to select date ranges that cover complete weeks. For example, if you select a date starting on a Monday, set the end date to a Sunday. If the start date is on a Friday, set the end date to a Thursday. You can also mouse over both the bars and dashed line to see the date and corresponding values.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="details">Performance report details</h2>
    <p>The first column that appears in the body of the report will vary based upon the report dimension that is selected (video name, player name, country, device type, etc.). All reports will display the following data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Video Views</strong> - The number of times a video started playing, recorded when the stream is started (does not include rewind or replay); it is not a measure of individual viewers</li>

      <li><strong>Play Requests</strong> - The number of times playback was requested either by a user pressing the play button or an auto-play event</li>
      <li><strong>Play Rate</strong> - The percentage of users that played the video after it was loaded (Video Views divided by Video Impressions)</li>
      <li><strong>Viewed Minutes</strong> - Total number of minutes the video was viewed</li>
      <li><strong>Engagement Score</strong> - The average percent watched per video view (calculated by adding all the percentage watched divided by the number of Video Views)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <strong>Video</strong> and <strong>Day</strong> dimensions will also display the <strong>Daily Unique Viewers</strong> which is the average daily unique viewers for the time period selected. This is calculated using the IP address and user agent of viewers.</p>

      <li>Although filters appear to be applied, they are not applicable to all sections of the Analytics module
        <ul>
          <li>Tags and custom field filters are not applied when you  click on a specific video or player to view the performance details for the video or player (the only exception being Player by Video or Day dimensions)</li>
          <li>Engagement graph (graph at the top of the Engagement report page) </li>

    <h2 id="export" class="BCL_conceptTitle">Exporting report data</h2>
    <p>Report data can be downloaded as both comma separated values and Excel formats. Note that the export feature saves the data directly from an <span translate="No">Analytics API</span> call. The exported data is not manipulated the way the UI data is, and currently contains all of the underlying data in the report, not just the subset of fields the UI shows. Some of the differences between what is shown in the UI vs. the exported data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Different units (minutes vs seconds)</li>
      <li>Rounding of numbers</li>
      <li>The data export contains both the performance and engagement metrics regardless of where you are in the UI</li>
      <li>The <strong>Other/Third Party</strong> entry will be exported with no associated video ID or video name</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Having all of the data in the original format from the API allows you to manipulate the data in ways other than what is provided in the UI.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Export Data" src="/assets/images/analytics/node10104-export.png" /></figure>
    <p>The export buttons above the graph will export the graph data. The export buttons above the table will export the table data. Note that the reports support print-friendly style sheets so printing a report or saving to PDF will generate a printer-friendly page.</p>
