    <p>The Analytics module can be used to generate custom, ad-hoc analytics reports that can be downloaded in comma separated values (.csv) or Microsoft Excel (.xlsx) formats. Reports can also be scheduled to run on a daily, weekly or monthly basis.</p>
    <p>The <span translate="No">Analytics API</span> is used to retrieve data from the analytics system. The <span translate="No">Analytics API</span> can also be used to create your own custom reports. For more information on the Analytics API, see the <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/analytics/">Video Cloud Analytics API</a> documentation.</p>
    <p>To begin creating custom reports, open the Analytics module and click on the <strong>Custom</strong> link in the left navigation.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: You may notice that the number of video views for a given day vary over time. For an explanation on why this may happen, see the <a href="/analytics/faq-analytics-module.html">Analytics FAQ</a>.</aside>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Reports that return more than one million rows will not load.</aside>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Simultaneous custom report requests within the same account will execute in series. If the reports have large date ranges and many fields are selected, there may be a delay before all the results are returned. A good alternative is to schedule large reports.</aside>

    <h2 id="timezone" class="BCL_conceptTitle">Reporting time zone</h2>
    <p>Data in custom reports is shown using the account's reporting time zone offset. The reporting time zone can be configured from the Video Cloud Studio home page by going to <strong>ADMIN&nbsp;&gt; Account Settings &gt; Default Reporting Time Zone</strong>. Note that only account administrators have access to the Account Settings.</p>
    <p>The reporting time zone is used to calculate day boundaries for reporting data. Changing the reporting time zone setting only affects data going forward, and changes are not applied retroactively. If you change this setting, you may see a flat spot or a spike in your data when looking at day boundaries where the change was applied. Updates to this setting may not take effect immediately, and analytics data may continue to refer to the old setting until the system processes the changes.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note that the default Reporting Time Zone applies <strong>only</strong> to the Analytics module and <strong>not</strong> to the Live Analytics which is technically a separated services by design</aside>

    <h2 id="account" class="BCL_conceptTitle">Selecting accounts</h2>
    <p>If you have access to multiple Video Cloud accounts, you can include data from the current Video Cloud account or select multiple accounts.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="include accounts" src="/assets/images/analytics/node14608-include-accounts.png" /></figure>
    <p>If you create a report that includes all accounts and those accounts use different time zones, data is reported using the time zone for that account.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="reporttype" class="BCL_conceptTitle">Selecting a report type</h2>
    <p>Select the type of report:</p>

      <li><strong><a href="#recurring">Recurring</a></strong> - The report can be scheduled to run on a daily, weekly or monthly basis
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Recurring reports are executed after the analytics reconciliation has taken place, usually 3 to 5 days after the end of a reporting period.</aside>

      <h3>Recurring report</h3>
      <p>Selecting <strong>Recurring</strong> will run the report on a recurring basis. Select a report <strong>Frequency</strong>:</p>
