            <p>The engagement report shows how users are engaging with your videos (the percentage of a video that viewers are watching).</p>

                The report body shows the following, when each dimension is selected:

                  <li><strong>Video</strong> - Video name, video ID, duration and engagement details for each video</li>

              <li>Calculating video engagement
                <ul>
                  <li>Engagement is a measure of views, not viewers</li>
                  <li>The video is divided into 100 equal parts and views are counted in each part</li>
                  <li>One viewer watching a part 5 times is no different from five viewers watching it 1 time</li>
                </ul>

              <li>Video engagement examples
                <ul>
                  <li>No watches yet - Engagement Score: 0</li>
                  <li>A viewer loads the page and watches the entire video - Engagement Score: 100 (100 percent viewed / 1 view)</li>
                  <li>The same viewer scrubs back and watches it again (browser not reloaded) - Engagement Score: 200 (200 percent viewed / 1 view)</li>
                  <li>Another viewer loads the page and watches the entire video - Engagement Score: 150 (300 percent viewed / 2 views)</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Recent and historical data
                <ul>
                  <li>For 32 days, Brightcove keeps detailed video analytics data (views for each one-hundredth of the video duration).</li>
                  <li>After 32 days, analytics data is moved to historical data. Only views at the 1%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% points are kept.</li>
                  <li>Exported reports only include views at the 1%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% points, even within the past 32 days.</li>
                  <li>Use the Analytics API to get detailed engagement data within the past 32 days.</li>
