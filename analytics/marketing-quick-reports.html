    <p>To create a quick report, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
        <li>Choose the report type you want to generate from the drop-down menu.</li>
        <li>Set the <strong>Start Date</strong> and <strong>End Date</strong> using the date picker.</li>
        <li><span class="button-blue">Create Report</span></li>
    </ol>

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Note: Quick Reports analytics uses a separate system from the general Video Cloud analytics system, and the two-track data are different. Therefore, you will see differences in some metrics if you compare the two.
      For example, Video Cloud analytics counts views as soon as a video starts. However, Quick Reports analytics only counts 'engaged' views. A view is 'engaged' if the watch duration is at least 10% of the video duration or 30 seconds (whichever is smaller). So for a 1-minute video, if 14 viewers start the video, but 6 of them stop it before 6 seconds have played, Video Cloud analytics would show 14 views, while Quick Reports would show 8. For videos longer than 5 minutes, the cutoff is 30 seconds.</aside>

    <h3>Missing or Partial Data</h3>
    <p>Data is typically processed within 48-72 hours and refreshed around 15:00 UTC. Running a report before this may result in missing or partial data for the last 48-72 hours. If you see missing data past 72 hours, please contact <a href="https://supportportal.brightcove.com/s/login">Brightcove Customer Support</a>.</p>
  
    <h3>Running a report multiple times does not refresh data</h3>
    <p>Quick reports are cached for 3 hours. Running multiple reports with the same date range within this period will return the same report.</p>

    <h3>Live videos are not included in report</h3>
    <p>Currently, live videos are not included in the report because Brightcove cannot calculate accurate watch percentages for these events.</p>
