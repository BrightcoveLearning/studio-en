      <p>Brightcove Server-Side Ad Insertion (SSAI) stitches ads into your content stream while it is being delivered. We provide support for both VOD and Live streams. Because ad stitching happens on the server-side, SSAI works with Brightcove's web player, the Native SDKs, and Beacon apps. For details about SSAI, see the <a href="https://ssai.support.brightcove.com/getting-started/video-cloud-ssai-overview.html">Video Cloud SSAI Overview</a> document.</p>
      <p>The SSAI Performance section within the Video Cloud Analytics module allow you monitor the efficiency of your ad providers and ad configurations. Here, you can track the performance and errors associated with your server-side advertising. </p>

    <p>Regardless of your specific goals for online video, understanding your audience is a key to developing a successful video strategy. The better you understand your viewers, the easier it is to create content that will engage them in formats they can easily consume. The Analytics module provides different reports that can be used to get analytics about your videos and players:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/analytics/performance-report-reference.html">Performance Report</a> - Provides details on the number of video views, traffic sources, device types and device operating systems</li>
      <li><a href="/analytics/engagement-report-reference.html">Engagement Report</a> - Provides details on how users are engaging with your videos; what percentage of a video viewers are watching</li>
      <li><a href="/analytics/trending-now-report-reference.html">Trending Now</a> - Provides the number of concurrent viewers for the past hour</li>
      <li><a href="/analytics/creating-custom-analytics-reports.html">Custom</a> - Provides the ability to create custom analytics reports</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Using these reports, you can generate up-to-date reports about how many viewers you have, how much content your viewers are watching, when they stop watching videos, and even the traffic sources for your content.</p>
    <p>This topic includes the following sections that describe how to use the Analytics module:</p>

    </ul>
    <p>Note that all data displayed in the Analytics module is also available through the Analytics API. For more information, see the <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/analytics/">Video Cloud Analytics API</a> documentation.</p>

    <h2 id="launch" class="BCL_conceptTitle">Launching the Analytics module</h2>
    <p>To launch the Analytics module:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Log into Video Cloud Studio.</li>
      <li>Open the Analytics module by clicking <strong>Analytics</strong> in the navigation header.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="timespan" class="BCL_conceptTitle">Selecting a time span</h2>
    <p>Use the date selector to specify the time period for the report, you can select a fixed date range or select a custom date range. Note that when a single day is selected, the graphs will display by hour.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"> <img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="date selector" src="/assets/images/analytics/node10119-date-picker.png" /></figure>
    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>Reporting time zone</h3>
      <p>Data in the Analytics module is shown using the account's reporting time zone. The time zone is displayed below the calendar control.</p>
      <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="time zone" src="/assets/images/analytics/node10119-timezone.png" /></figure>
      <p>The reporting time zone is used to calculate day boundaries for reporting data. Changing the reporting time zone setting only affects data going forward, and changes are not applied retroactively. If you change this setting, you may see a flat spot or a spike in your data when looking at day boundaries where the change was applied. Updates to this setting may not take effect immediately, and analytics data may continue to refer to the old setting until the system processes the changes.</p>
      <p>The reporting time zone can be configured as part of the account settings. For information on changing the reporting time zone, see <a href="/admin/managing-account-settings.html">Managing Account Settings</a>.</p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="search" class="BCL_conceptTitle">Searching for a video</h2>
    <p>The search feature can be used to search for a specific video.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="search field" src="/assets/images/analytics/node10119-search.png" /></figure>
    <p>The following video properties will be searched:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name</li>
      <li>Short description</li>
      <li>Long description</li>
      <li>Tags</li>
      <li>Video ID</li>
      <li>Reference ID</li>
      <li>All custom fields</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A list of matches will be displayed below the search field.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="search results" src="/assets/images/analytics/node10119-search-results.png" /></figure>
    <p>Clicking a video link will open the report that is "in context". For example, if you are looking at the engagement for your account and then use search to locate a specific video, clicking the link to the video will open the Engagement Report. If you are looking at the Performance report, searching and clicking a link will open the Performance Report.</p>
    <p>For a complete list of options that are available when searching for videos in the Analytics module, see <a href="/analytics/how-search-videos-analytics-module.html">How to Search for Videos in the Analytics Module</a>.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: The Analytics reports do include analytics for videos that have been deleted from your account. You cannot search for deleted videos in the Analytics module. To get a report on a deleted video, you will need to know the video ID for the deleted video and use the <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/analytics/">Analytics API</a> to generate the report.</aside>
