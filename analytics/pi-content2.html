    <p>Viewing by Day Part reflects the local time that a viewer consumed content, grouped by the time of day when the view occurred. If a view stretches across multiple day parts, that view will be counted in each of the day parts it spans.</p>
    <p>Values are estimations based on random viewer sampling. For viewer populations of more than 30,000, statistics are projected from a random sampling of viewer behaviour. 30,000 viewers ensures a margin of error less than 1%.</p>
