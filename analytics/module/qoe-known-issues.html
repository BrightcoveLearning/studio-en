    <h2 id="Video_Start_Time">Video Start Time</h2>
    <p>When IMA3 is configured, regardless of whether there's a preroll, the Analytics emitter in Brightcove Player falls back to <code translate="no">loadstart</code> when calculating Video Start Time. In click-to-play player configurations, this inflates Video Start Time incorrectly. </p>
    <h3>Resolution</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>For player v6, update the player version to 6.67.5 or  higher.</li>
        <li>For player v7, update the player version to 7.9.0 or higher.</li>

    <h3>Rebuffering when empty VAST ads are returned for postrolls</h3>
    <p>At the end of the main video, you can see 4 seconds of buffering, which can decrease the QoE score.</p>
    <h3>Rebuffering seconds set to 10 by the analytics emitter in iOS when IMA3 plugin is used</h3>
    <p>When the IMA3 plugin is active, the analytics emitter in Brightcove Player consistently sets <code translate="no">rebuffering_seconds</code> to 10 on every engagement beacon in iOS, even in cases when thereâ€™s no rebuffering or actual rebuffering time is much shorter. As a result, this can lead to skewed/inflated rebuffering time in QoE.</p>
    <h3>Buffering seconds set to 10 seconds in iOS mobile devices.</h3>
    <p>When a player is set to loop and has the scrolling player into view plugin, the analytics emitter in Brightcove Player consistently sets <code translate="no">buffering_seconds</code> to 10 on every engagement beacon in iOS when switching between apps. As a result, this can lead to skewed/inflated rebuffering time in QoE.</p>
    <h3>Rebuffering seconds are not always set in engagement beacons when buffering occurs</h3>
    <p>Rebuffering time metrics are not always set in engagement beacons when buffering occurs.</p>
    <h3>Resolution</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>For player v6, update the player version to 6.67.6 or higher. Use IMA v3.8.2 for IMA3 version 3, and use IMA v4.3.1 for IMA3 version 4.</li>
        <li><p>For player v7, update the player version to 7.7.0 or higher. Use the IMA version 5 if you're using player v7.0.0 or higher but less than v7.7.0.</p>
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: There is no issue for player v7.7.0 or higher.</aside>

    <p>Safari browsers do not report rendition information. There is an opt-in mechanism to gather this information in player v7.5.0 and later. It requires a second manifest request.</p>
