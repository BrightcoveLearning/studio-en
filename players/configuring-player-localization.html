    <p>Brightcove Players can be localized so that interface elements appear in various languages. If the player localization properties are not configured, the interface will display in English.</p>
    <p>To configure the player <strong>Localization</strong>, follow these steps.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Open the <strong>Players</strong> module.</li>
      <li>Click on a player to open the player properties.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Player Information</strong> in the left navigation menu.</li>
      <li>In the <strong>Localization</strong> field, enter the two letter language code for the language and press enter. As you type, the language list will be filtered. You can also click on a value to select it.

    <h2 id="support">Checking the language</h2>
    <p>To use the localized language, set the preferred language in the browser. The exact steps vary depending on browser and operating system. If the browser's preferred language is English, or a language not available, you will see the default, or English, text. Browsers do not have perfectly standardized locale detection, so it can be a bit complicated. Broadly, browsers look to determine the desired language in this order:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Check if the embedding page has a lang attribute on the <code translate="No">&lt;html&gt;</code> element</li>
      <li>Check browser specific locale configurations</li>
      <li>Fall back to English</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: This technique will only work with the Advanced (in-page) code implementation. Since the Standard implementation loads in an iframe, the browser language setting does not flow into it.</aside>
    <p>If you use the HTML attribute you do not have to set the preferred language as default in your browser or computer as the player will use the one on the <code translate="No">lang</code> attribute.</p>
    <pre>&lt;html lang="es"&gt; </pre>
    <p>Also, if you are using an iframe, keep in mind that you will need to add the query parameter to the player URL.</p>
