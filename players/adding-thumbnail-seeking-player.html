    <p>Players can be configured to display video thumbnail images over the player progress bar. Thumbnail images show a preview of the video at that point in time and allow viewers to preview a video and jump to a specific point in the video. Play the video below and hover over the progress bar to see the thumbnail seeking feature.</p>

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: If you build custom implementations on top of the Brightcove Playback API (PAPI) responses, please note the following:
      <ul>
        <li>With Server-Side Ad Insertion (SSAI), the thumbnails manifest is located in the VMAP instead of the PAPI response.</li>
        <li>With non-SSAI, the thumbnails manifest is included in the PAPI response.</li>
      </ul>
    </aside>
    <h3>When are thumbnail images generated?</h3>
    <p>Brightcove generates the images dynamically on request. Any video ingested with Dynamic Delivery will have images generated on the first request. This ensures that images are not created for unused videos. Once generated, images are cached locally and on the CDN for repeat viewing, just like any other image.</p>
    <h3>How often are images generated?</h3>
    <p>The thumbnails list is filtered down based on the pixel width of the player at initialization. This list varies significantly depending on player styling, window sizing, platform/device, etc. The thumbnail plugin aims to show a new thumbnail roughly every 30px as the user hovers over the progress bar. For example, if the player is 1,500px wide, the player will attempt to filter the list down to 50 thumbnails. The remaining time intervals for the WebVTT cues are adjusted according to the contentâ€™s duration.</p>
    <!-- <p>Images are generated every 5 seconds for videos < 1 hour and every 10 seconds for videos > 1 hour.</p> -->
