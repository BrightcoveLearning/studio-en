    <p>The Plugins option in the Players module can be used to add a <a href="#add_plugin">player plugin</a>, <a href="#add_stylesheet">stylesheet</a> or add a <a href="#add_script">script </a> to a Brightcove Player. The Plugins page will list all plugins that have been configured for the player. Brightcove provided plugins will not be displayed (i.e. Social, Audience, etc.).</p>

    <p>Plugins are typically developed to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Modify the default behavior of a player</li>
      <li>Add functionality to a player</li>
      <li>Customize player appearance</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For information on creating your own custom plugins, see <a href="https://player.support.brightcove.com/coding-topics/step-step-plugin-development.html">Step-by-Step: Plugin Development</a>.</p>
    <p>To configure plugins for the player, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Click <strong>Players</strong> in the navigation header to open the Players module.</li>
      <li>Click the link for the player you want to configure.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Plugins</strong> in the left navigation menu.</li>
      <li>Click <span class="button-blue">Add a Plugin<i class="button-icon" data-feather="chevron-down"></i></span> and then click on a plugin type:

    <h2 id="Plugin_code_location">Plugin code location</h2>
    <p>When a plugin, be it a Brightcove supplied plugin or a custom plugin you have built, is added to the player as shown above, or using the Player Management API, the plugin becomes part of the player code itself. The plugin code is retrieved from its storage location on the Internet and made part of the code for the specific player to which the plugin was added. To illustrate this further, when you use the Advanced (in-page) player implementation you see a <code translate="No">&lt;script&gt;</code> tag similar to the following:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
	<code class="language-html" translate="No">&lt;script src="//players.brightcove.net/1507807800001/default_default/index.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>This is the code that defines your Brightcove Player. This file includes code for any of the plugins you have added to the player. The plugin code is also included in the Standard (iframe) player implementation.</p>
    <p>If you develop your own plugin and change the source code in its Internet storage location, be sure you re-publish your player as the new plugin code will NOT be part of the JavaScript file unless you do so.</p>
