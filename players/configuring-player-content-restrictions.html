    <p>The player <strong>Content Restriction</strong> properties can be used to restrict a player to particular countries, or block a player from particular countries. Domain restrictions can be added to a player to limit the domains where the player can be used.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">
      <h4>Notes:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The <strong>Geo Restriction</strong> properties are only available to Enterprise and Professional accounts. <strong>Domain Restriction</strong> is available to all accounts.</li>
        <li>IP address can also be used to limit playback For information, see <a href="https://player.support.brightcove.com/content-protection/restricting-video-playback-using-ip-address.html">Restricting Video Playback Using IP Address</a>.</li>
        <li>IE 10 and 11, in compatibility mode, will show Domain Restriction errors when viewing domain-restricted content.</li>
      </ul>
    </aside>
    <p>To view and edit the <strong>Content Restriction</strong> properties for a player, open the Players module, click on a player name and click <strong>Content Restriction </strong>in the left navigation menu.</p>

    <h2 id="domains">Configuring domain restrictions</h2>
    <p>Domain restrictions can be set on players to limit the domains where players can be used. If the player publishing code is copied and used on another site, domain restrictions would prevent the player from loading any videos. Publishers must use the in-page embed code to actually get playback working on those domains that have been whitelisted. Publishers cannot use the iframe embed code on a whitelisted domain (or any other domain) and expect playback to function properly.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">
      <h4>Notes:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>While domain restrictions can help prevent unauthorized distribution of your content, customers seeking maximum content security should look at DRM solutions instead. See <a href="/general/overview-digital-rights-management-drm-video-cloud.html">Digital Rights Management (DRM) in Video Cloud</a> for more information.</li>
        <li>For viewers using Internet Explorer, the domain restriction feature requires version 10 or newer. Viewers using Internet Explorer &lt; 10 will not get playback at all.</li>
        <li>Domain restrictions are supported when using a Gallery In-Page Experience and the Recommended (JavaScript) embed code.</li>
        <li>Domain restricted players are not compatible with AMP integrations. This is because the AMP integration creates an iframe which in turn isn't supported by domain restricted players.</li>
        <li>When using the domain restriction feature, domain restrictions should be configured for all players in your account. If all players are not configured with domain restrictions, someone could take the policy key from an unprotected player and use it to play any video.</li>
        <li>While there is no limit on the number of domains that can be added in Studio, there is a limit on the length of the URL for the API request - included in that URL will be the comma-delimited list of domains. Therefore there is a limit on the number of domains that can be specified, but the number will depend on how long the domain names are. </li>
      </ul>
    </aside>
    <p>To configure a domain restriction for a player, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Enter one or more complete domain URLs (such as http://www.brightcove.com or https://www.brightcove.com) to restrict your player's availability to these particular domains. Be sure to include either http:// or https://. Click <strong>+</strong>.

        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">
          <h4>Notes:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Complete URLs must be provided. Wildcards in URLs are not supported. URLs should not end with a /.</li>
            <li>Only domains, not specific paths, are supported. For example, you can add <code translate="No">https://www.brightcove.com</code>, but <strong>not</strong> <code translate="No">https://www.brightcove.com<span class="bcls-highlight">/documentation</span></code></li>
