    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: A maximum of 200 players can be created. Brightcove discourages the creation of a large numbers of players but, if this is necessary, please contact your Account Manager and request an increase in the number of players you can create.</aside>
    <p>When a new player is created using the Players module, the player is built using the latest player version as published by Brightcove. The  player version appears on the Players module homepage.  Note that all players may not be the same version. As Brightcove continues to develop and improve the Brightcove player, new player versions will be released. By default, updates are applied to all players automatically. To prevent auto-updating of a player, you must set the <strong>Update Mode</strong> setting to <strong>Manual</strong> (also known as locking a player). For more information, see <a href="/players/setting-player-update-mode-and-version.html">Setting the Player Update Mode and Version</a>.</p>

    <p>The <strong>Embed Code &amp; URL</strong> button can generate the player embed code and URL for the <strong>preview player</strong> or the <strong>published player</strong>. Typically, the preview player embed code and URL are used to preview the changes being made to a player. This gives you the ability to see the changes in action before publishing the player out to a production site. Once a player is published, changes will be reflected in all instances of that particular player.</p>
