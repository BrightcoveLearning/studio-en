    <p>When setting up integrations, two options are available: <strong>Viewing Data</strong> and <strong>Contact Object</strong>. Depending on the needs to be covered, one option or another can be selected.</p>

    <h2 id="Viewing_Data_integration">Viewing Data integration</h2>
    <p>The Viewing Data integration allows you to export event-based data at a granular level. It lets you get viewers, players, videos, and date data. 
        For more information about the properties this export provides, see <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/marketing-automation/general/data-fields/viewing-data-integration-properties.html">Server-Side: Viewing Data Integration Properties</a>.</p>
    <p>The viewing data is bound to a custom object and appended, not overwritten, on each contact sync.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Contact__Object_integration">Contact Object integration</h2>
    <p>The Contact Object integration types export daily data at the user level for all existing users in both MAP/CRM systems and Brightcove. For more information about the properties this export provides, see <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/marketing-automation/general/data-fields/contact-integration-properties.html">Server-Side: Contact Object Integration Properties</a>.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: The system only updates users who exist in both systems. It will not create new contacts in your MAP/CRM system.
        You can align users using their Contact ID.
    </aside>
    <p>Contact Integration data is bound to the contact and aggregates data at the user level. This export overwrites the existing data with the most updated records with each sync.</p>
