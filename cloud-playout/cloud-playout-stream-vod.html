    <p>The  Cloud Playout module enables broadcasters and media publishers to use a collection of VOD videos and live streams and then stream them as a linear channel. The channel can be streamed to Brightcove Live, Amazon S3 or a specified RTMP URL.</p>
    <p>To access the Cloud Playout module, click <strong>Cloud Playout</strong> in the navigation menu. A list of all Cloud Playout channels that have been created will be displayed (if any).</p>

    <h2 id="channel">Creating a channel</h2>
    <p>To create a new Cloud Playout channel, follow these steps. </p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart" style="--s:1">
      <li>Click <strong>Cloud Playout</strong> in the navigation header.</li>
      <li>
        Click <span class="button-blue">Add New</span>:
        <figure class="bcls-figure">
          <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/cloud-playout/cloudplayout-new-channel-dialog.png" alt="New Channel">
          <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">New Channel</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </li>
      <li>Enter the channel <strong>Identification</strong> details:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Name</strong> - Name for the channel. The name must have English characters and the following special characters are allowed:   _ . : / = + - </li>
          <li><strong>Description</strong> - Channel description</li>
          <li><strong>Image URL</strong> - URL to an image file for the channel; meant to be a channel image that could be retrieved as part of the channel's metadata</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Enter the channel <strong>Schedule</strong> details.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Loop Playout Content</strong> - If <strong>On</strong>, the program will be played in a loop and the <strong>End Date/Time</strong> will be enabled. The program can still be modified at any time and the changes will be reflected in the current program and the loops to follow. See the <a href="#looping">Creating a looping program</a> section below.</li>
          <li><strong>Ad Insertion</strong> - If on, allows ads to be displayed during channel playback. If this option is selected, you can only output to a <strong>Brightcove Live Event</strong> or <strong>Amazon S3 Bucket</strong>. See <a href="/cloud-playout/enabling-server-side-ads.html">Monetizing Content</a>.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Start Date/Time</strong> - Time when the channel will start playing out. The start time for all assets will be calculated by adding their duration to this start time. This time can be updated only when the channel is not in running state.
            <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--warning language-editable">Note: it takes 1-2 minutes for the initial startup of a channel, so if the start is time-sensitive, schedule it for 2 minutes before the time you want to initiate playback.</aside>
          </li>
          <li><strong>End Date/Time</strong> - If no value is entered and <strong>Loop Playout Content</strong> is not selected, the stream will end once the playout is complete. If <strong>Loop Playout Content</strong> is selected and there is no <strong>End Date/Time</strong>, the playout will be streamed until the channel is stopped. This time can be updated at any time.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If you will be using Live inputs, set <strong>Live Input</strong> to On, and enter a Slate URL, unless you are going to use the default Brightcove MP4 for you slate. The slate MP4 will play whenever Live input is stopped because the encoder is stopped or some technical issue blocks the live stream. <strong>Note that <strong>the Slate URL must be a static URL that is always available</strong> (short-lived CDN URLs are not allowed).</strong></li>
      <li>
        Import closed captions is enabled by default; if you do not want to import captions, disable it now or while the channel is in DRAFT state:
        <figure class="bcls-figure">

          <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Import Captions</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </li>
      <li>Enter the channel <strong>Destination</strong> details. Cloud Playout  supports 2 outputs at the same time. For example, you can output HLS into an S3 Bucket and an RTMP feed to a Brightcove Live Channel or a 3rd party ingestion point. Note that combining <strong>Brightcove Live Event</strong> and <strong>RTMP</strong> as simultaneous destinations is not supported.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Optimize Display for</strong> - Controls the bitrate and dimensions for the output
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Mobile &amp; Web</strong> - If checked, HD Output (RTMP or HLS single bitrate)</li>
              <li><strong>Smart TV</strong> - If checked, full HD Output (RTMP or HLS single bitrate)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Output Region</strong> - The region where the channel will be created. Brightcove recommends selecting a region geographically closest to where the majority of your audience is expected.</li>
          <li><strong>Output to</strong> - Select an output method for the channel
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Brightcove Live Event</strong> - Create or use a previously created Brightcove Live  Channel. When creating a new channel, the region of the channel will be optimized based upon the <strong>Output Region</strong> that was selected.
                <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">If you are using Brightcove Live, you can also set the destination as a redundant group to get automatic failover for uninterrupted, reliable playback. See <a href="/cloud-playout/channel-live-redundancy.html">Using Live Redundancy with Channels</a> for more details.</aside>
              </li>
              <li><strong>RTMP</strong> - Select to output the stream to an RTMP or RTP ingestion point. RTP is not available for third party ingestion points; you can use it only when <strong>Ad Insertion</strong> and <strong>Brightcove Live Event</strong> is enabled. When selected, an <strong>RTMP URL</strong> field will appear - enter the RTMP input URL for your live streaming service.</li>
              <li><strong>Amazon S3 Bucket </strong>- Select to push an HLS output to an Amazon S3 bucket. You will be required to enter Bucket Name, Region, Access Key and Secret Key. The bucket should be public and writeable. To avoid entering all this information every time you create a channel see <a href="/cloud-playout/configuring-s3-buckets.html">Configuring S3 Buckets</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note that outputting to <strong>Brightcove Live Event</strong> will automatically generate live hours for your account, which are billable. There is no addition charge for using Cloud Playout, but normal charges for live streaming hours apply. Outputting to RTMP or Amazon S3 do not generate billable live hours:

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">This section only applies if you are including live events in your channel.</aside>
    <p>For your live encoder, you will need the RTMP ingest point for your channel. You can find it in the <strong>Channel Settings</strong></p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure">
      <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/cloud-playout/cloudplayout-rtmp-ingest-point.png" alt="Ingest Point">
      <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Ingest Point</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--warning language-editable">
      Please note that Cloud Playout uses a CNAME mapping for the ingest point but in rare cases this mapping may not be complete and the channel may temporarily show an IP Address. Check the channel settings before starting a live stream to the channel and wait until the Ingest Point shows a CNAME if you see an IP address such as the one below:
      <figure class="bcls-figure">

      </figure>
    </aside>
    <p>Depending on the encoder you are using, you may need to enter both the RTMP ingest point and the stream name. The stream name for the channel is the <strong>Channel ID</strong>, which is also the last part of the Ingest Point address.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note that if you are using the OBS software encoder, you will need to specify a <strong>Custom...</strong> service, and will need to input a <strong>Server</strong> and <strong>Stream Key</strong>. The <strong>Server</strong> will be the first part of the <strong>Ingest Point</strong>, and the <strong>Steam Key</strong> will be the remaining part, as shown in the example below:
