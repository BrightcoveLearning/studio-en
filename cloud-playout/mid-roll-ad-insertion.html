		<p>Before reading this topic, you should look at <a href="/cloud-playout/enabling-server-side-ads.html">Monetizing Cloud Playout</a>, which covers enabling a Cloud Playout channel for SSAI and setting up pre-roll and post-roll ad insertion.</p>
		<p>As you will see below, mid-roll ads work a bit differently.</p>

		<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
		<p>Mid-roll ad insertions depend on cuepoints created for the video either through Studio or the CMS API. Cloud Playout imports the cuepoint data for the videos in the channel and sets mid-roll ad insertion points based on them. For information on how to add cuepoints, see <a href="/media/working-cue-points-media-module.html">Working with Cue Points in the Media Module</a> </p>

		<p>Import of cuepoints for mid-roll ads can be enabled or disabled when you create the channel, or any time after that, regardless of the state of the channel:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Cloud Playout only sets ad positions based on ad cuepoints (code cuepoints are ignored).</li>
			<li>The pre-roll and post-roll ad cuepoints automatically created by Video Cloud are ignored as pre-roll and post-roll ads are managed differently in Cloud Playout - see <a href="/cloud-playout/enabling-server-side-ads.html#ads">Enabling Server-Side Ads</a>.</li>
			<li>Only the timestamps for the ad cuepoints are used to determine mid-roll ad timings. Cuepoint metadata is ignored.</li>
			<li>
				The default duration for mid-roll is 30 seconds. This can be changed in the channel settings: minimum duration: 30 seconds; maximum duration: 10 minutes.
				<p>The duration of mid-roll slots can be changed at any time, regardless of the channel state:</p>

					<figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Edit Mid-Roll Slot Duration (RUNNING State)</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Notes:
					<ul>
						<li>The modified duration will not be applicable for the currently playing Ad slot. Subsequent Ad slots (within the same and subsequent videos) will use the modified Ad slot duration.</li>
						<li>The Cloud Playout EPG is generated dynamically and as close to reality as possible. Changing the mid-roll duration may cause the EPG to show inaccurate schedules for a while, but it will auto-correct itself after a short period.</li>
						<li>When Cloud Playout is currently playing an Ad (mid-roll or post-roll) and if a user attempts to use <strong>Play Now</strong> option to skip to another asset, the Ad will still continue to play until the programmed ad slot duration. During this time, the video that the user attempted to Play Now will be overwritten with the Ad for the remainder of the Ad slot duration. We recommend waiting for the completion of Ad before using the <strong>Play Now</strong> switch.</li>
					</ul>
					</aside>
			</li>
			<li>Mid-roll ads can only be inserted in VOD content, not in ad placeholders for <a href="/cloud-playout/adding-bumpers-to-vod.html">bumpers</a> or <a href="/cloud-playout/enabling-server-side-ads.html">pre-roll and post-roll ads</a>. For Live streams, all ad insertion is handled through SCTE-35 cuepoints.</li>
			<li>The start and end times, and the duration of assets in the program in the Cloud Playout UI and in the EPG, will reflect the mid-roll ad content.</li>
			<li>
				Importing cuepoint data for mid-roll ads can be enabled or disabled at any time, regardless of the current state of the channel.

				<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						When a channel has mid-roll import option disabled and asset A is currently playing and it has mid-roll cue-points, and if the mid-roll import option is turned ON now on channel settings - the Ad slots in the current playing asset will not be honoured for the current iteration. However, mid-rolls for subsequent assets will be imported.
					</li>
					<li>
						When a channel has mid-roll import option enabled and asset A is currently playing and it has mid-roll cue-points, and if the mid-roll import option is turned off now - the Ad slots in the current playing asset will be honoured on a best effort basis. Some Ad slots which are so nearly located to the playtime of the current playing asset might still play Ads.
					</li>
          <li>Adding/removing cue-points to a currently playing asset is handled based on various factors. Factors such as current playtime position, existence of other mid-roll cue points etc., will influence the way Cloud Playout handles dynamic addition/removal of cue points of currently playing asset.</li>

		<p>If mid-roll cuepoint import has been enabled, videos with valid mid-roll cuepoints will have a green dotted icon next to the video title in the program:</p>
