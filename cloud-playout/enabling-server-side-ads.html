		<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
		<p>One way to monetize a Cloud Playout channel is through advertising. The most reliable way to deliver ads is through server-side ad insertion, or SSAI.</p>
		<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">If you are interested in adding SSAI capability to your account, contact your account manager.</aside>
		<p>This topic covers enabling SSAI for a Cloud Playout channel, and setting up pre-roll and post-roll ad insertion. Because mid-roll ad insertion works differently, that is covered in <a href="/cloud-playout/mid-roll-ad-insertion.html">Adding Mid-Roll Ads to a Channel</a>. Pre-roll, post-roll, and mid-roll ads can all be inserted into a channel.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">
      For SSAI-enabled channels, the destination must be set to an ad-enabled RTP live event:

    <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
    <p>To use server-side ad insertion (SSAI) with Cloud Playout the following are required:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The account must be enabled for Brightcove Live and Live with SSAI.</li>
      <li>Brightcove Live and/or S3 must be used as the destination for the channel.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="ads">Enabling Server-Side Ads</h2>
    <p>When you create a channel, you have the option to enable SSAI, so that server-side ads are displayed using Brightcove's Server-Side Ad Insertion technology. You can also enable importing midroll cuepoints:</p>

		</figure>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Notes: 
      <ul>
        <li>When using ad insertion, the channel can only be output to a Brightcove Live Event.</li>
      </ul>
      </aside>
    <h3>Configuring Ad tags and fill slates</h3>
    <p>Ensure that you have ad tags and fill slates configured as part of your account administration. For information on configuring ad tags, see <a href="/admin/configuring-server-side-ad-settings.html">Configuring Server-Side Ad Settings</a>. Fill slates are content that can be served when there are gaps in a live stream ad break. For information on creating fill slates, see <a href="https://live.support.brightcove.com/admin/managing-live-settings.html">Managing Live Settings</a>.</p>
    <p>
      <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Cloud Playout will use the default ad slate configured as part of the <a href="https://live.support.brightcove.com/admin/managing-live-settings.html">Live Settings</a>.</aside>
    </p>
    <h3>Creating placeholder ad break videos</h3>
    <p>You need to indicate which video(s) should be used as "placeholder" videos. "Placeholder" videos will be inserted into the program listing to indicate that an ad should be served and the length of the ad. This needs to be done because when using Server-Side Ad Insertion with Brightcove Live, the "placeholder" video will be replaced with ad content. If you do not insert an ad "placeholder" video, parts of the actual video will be replaced with ad content. If the ad duration is shorter than the ad returned, SSAI will show the ad slate. If the ad duration is longer than the ads returned, the ads will be displayed followed by the ad slate. </p>
    <p>You may need to create/upload video source files that have video lengths equal to the ad break durations you want to have (i.e. 2 mins, 4 mins, etc.). The content of these videos doesn't matter as they will not actually be played as part of a program. </p>
    <p>To mark a video as a "placeholder" video, use the Media module to edit the video properties for these videos and tag them with <code translate="No">cp-ad-holder</code>.

    <h3>Enabling Server-Side Ads for a channel</h3>
    <p>When creating a channel, set the <strong>Ad Insertion</strong> option to <strong>On</strong>.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="report switcher" src="/assets/images/cloud-playout/playout-ad-insertion-option.png" /></figure>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: For existing channels, the Ad Insertion setting cannot be changed.</aside>
    <h3>Inserting ad placeholders into a program</h3>
    <p>You need to insert ad placeholders into the program listing where ads should be displayed. Follow these steps to insert ad placeholders.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Note that the placeholders are only required for SSAI with VOD content. If the channel includes a Live stream, ad placement and duration are handled via SCTE-35 cue points sent from the encoder. See <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/live-api/ssai/live-api-cue-points-and-ad-beacons-ssai.html">live-api/ssai/live-api-cue-points-and-ad-beacons-ssai.html</a> and <a href="https://live.support.brightcove.com/live-module/implementing-server-side-ads-live-module.html">Implementing Server-Side Ads in the Live Module</a> for more information.</aside>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart" style="--s:1">
      <li>Click a channel name to edit it.</li>
      <li>In the program listing, click the checkbox next to the video <strong>after</strong> which you want an ad to play.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Insert Ads</strong> and select an <strong>ad duration</strong>. The list of ad durations is generated based upon the lengths of all the ad break "placeholder" videos (tagged <code translate="No">cp-ad-holder</code>).
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="report switcher" src="/assets/images/cloud-playout/playout-insert-ads-button.png" /></figure>
      </li>
      <li>Click <strong>Ok</strong>. The "placeholder" video with the selected length will be inserted into the program after the selected video.
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="report switcher" src="/assets/images/cloud-playout/playout-ad-break-inserted.png" /></figure>
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: The video that is inserted as a "placeholder" <strong>will not</strong> be played as part of the program. This video is only used to indicate where an ad request will be made and the ad length.</aside>
      </li>
      <li>Click <strong>Save</strong> to save the changes to the program.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Selecting the ad configuration</h3>
    <p>Once the program begins playing, click <strong>View in Brightcove Live</strong> to view the channel in the Live module. The dropdown below the player can be used to select the ad configuration that will be used.</p>
