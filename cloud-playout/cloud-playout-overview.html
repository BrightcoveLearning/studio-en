    <h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
    <p>The following assumptions and limitations apply.</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Your videos must be ingested or re-transcoded using a Dynamic Delivery profile and <strong>must have an MP4 rendition</strong></li>
        <figure class="bcls-figure">

          <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Ingest Profiles with MP4</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </li>
      <li>For channels to work in Beacon, you need to <strong>specify Brightcove Live as the destination</strong>.</li>
      <li>The maximum input bitrate and resolution supported for Cloud Playout is 20MBPS/1080p for VOD and live inputs.</li>
      <li>Brightcove recommends using videos with at least a 2 minute duration to ensure a correct transition between videos and electronic program guide accuracy</li>
      <li>Captions (text tracks) added to videos currently will not display in Cloud Playout channels. Support for captions will be added in a future release.</li>
      <li>The minimum length for Live events is 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Every Live Event in Cloud Playout shares an 1:1 relation with a Video Cloud remote asset. This remote asset cannot be re-used in other channels. If the live event is removed from the channel, the associated remote asset will be automatically deleted. When a channel is deleted, any associated remote assets will also be deleted automatically.</li>
      <li>Videos <strong>shared</strong> to the account from another account currently cannot be added to a Cloud Playout channel.</li>
      <li>When a live event is currently playing, but no active feed is available, the slate content will be played in a loop until the live feed resumes or the event ends. There will be a delay of approximately 30 seconds before the slate MP4 starts playing.</li>
      <!--<li><strong>Input Looper : if the asset URL is duplicated, then input looper rely on order for switching; if the order is changes during the course of the switching , then subsequent N+1 switch it attempt to create would rely on the order.Â </strong></li>-->
      <li>If the Video Cloud account is configured for geo-restriction, then the channel <strong>Output Region</strong> should be created in a region compatible with the Video Cloud geo-restriction policy.</li>
      <li>For the best experience, Brightcove recommends using the Google Chrome browser.</li>
      <li>
        For SSAI-enabled channels, the destination must be set to an ad-enabled RTP live event:
