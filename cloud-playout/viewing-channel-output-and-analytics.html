    <h2 id="analytics">Viewing channel output and analytics</h2>
    <p>While the channel is in a <strong>RUNNING</strong> state, it is possible to view channel output and analytics. Click on the channel on the <strong>Channels</strong> page to open the channel details.</p>

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: The preview image is updated every three seconds.</aside>
    <p>Click <strong>View in Brightcove Live</strong> to open the Live module Control Room page with the currently running program. The currently playing video in the program will be highlighted with a <strong>Playing Now</strong> banner. Also notice the <strong>Status</strong> notification in the upper right, and the <img src="/assets/images/cloud-playout/cloudplayout-video-icon.png" alt="Live icon"> that will be green if there is a live feed available. Otherwise it will be red if a live event is currently playing, or gray if VOD content is playing.</p>
    <p>The following analytics values will be displayed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Network In</strong> - Average bytes per second in the last minute</li>
      <li><strong>Network Out</strong> - Average bytes per second in the last minute</li>
      <li><strong>Frames Dropped</strong> - Percent of frames dropped in the last minute</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <strong>Network In</strong> analytics are particularly useful for detecting when the stream for a live event has failed (you should also see the slate video playing in the output rather than the live stream):

    <p>In the <strong>Schedule</strong> beneath the analytics, you can click <span class="button-blue-text-bordered">Show Playing Now</span> to see the item that is currently playing. If you hover over any <strong><em>future</em></strong> item, the item thumbnail will change to Play icon, which you can click to have that item play next (instead of the next item in the schedule):</p>
