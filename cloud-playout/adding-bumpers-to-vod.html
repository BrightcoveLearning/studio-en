    <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>If you are not enabling Server-Side Ads (SSAI) for your channel, you may still want to include bumpers - pre- or post-roll short videos which might be in-house ads or some other kind of announcement or promotion. You might also use bumpers to create buffers for your live programming segments.</p>
    <p>There is nothing you need to do in the initial channel creation - the option to <span class="button-blue">Insert Bumpers</span> will appear automatically after the channel is created. This applies to all channels, including those enabled for Live streams or SSAI</p>
    <p>You can add multiple bumpers to the same video, and you can rearrange bumpers in the program order, just as you can videos. However, some care needs to be taken in doing this or you may end up with an inaccurate EPG. See <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/cloud-playout-apis/getting-started/overview-epg-api.html#epg_bumpers">The EPG and Bumpers</a> for full details.</p>
    <p>Bumpers will <strong>not</strong> appear in the <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/cloud-playout-apis/references/reference-epg.html">EPG</a> but the duration of the bumper will be added to the video before or after (depending on whether it is pre-roll or post-roll).</p>

    <p>The bumpers can be any video in your account, but it must have <strong>one of</strong> the following tags:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code translate="no">cp-preroll-bumper</code></li>
      <li><code translate="no">cp-postroll-bumper</code></li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--warning">Potential problems:
			<ul>
				<li>If you add both of these tags to the same video, it will still work as a bumper, but the <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/cloud-playout-apis/getting-started/overview-epg-api.html">EPG</a> will be inaccurate.</li>
				<li>Similarly, for SSAI-enabled channels, ad placeholders are treated as post-roll ads. You should not have a pre-roll bumper followed by an ad placeholder, as this effectively creates a pre-roll<i data-feather="arrow-right"></i>post-roll sequence that will cause the EPG to be inaccurate.</li>

    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">

        </figure>
      </li>
      <li>
        In the <strong>Bumpers</strong> dialog select <strong>Pre-Roll</strong> or <strong>Post-Roll</strong> and then click <span class="button-blue">Insert</span> beside the bumper video you want to insert.<sup><strong><a href="#note1-2">[1-2]</a></strong></sup>

    <ul style="list-style: none;">
      <li id="note1-1" style="list-style: none;"><sup><strong>[1-1]</strong></sup> If you select multiple items, the same bumper will be added to each one. If you want different bumpers for different items, add them one by one.</li>
      <li id="note1-2" style="list-style: none;"><sup><strong>[1-2]</strong></sup> Remember that only videos that have been <a href="#Enabling_bumper_content">tagged as bumpers</a> will appear in the list.</li>
