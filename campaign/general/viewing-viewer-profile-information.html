The Viewer Profiles page will display a list of all viewing activity from Audience tracking integrations for the selected time period. The calendar control can be used to select a new date range. The Viewer value will be the value that was used to identify the user. Typically, this will be the email address captured on a lead form. Data can be sorted by clicking on the column headers.</p>
