    <p>When using Campaign Tracking or SSO integrations, the Campaign module allows you to select a video and then view activity for that video. This allows you to see who viewed a particular video.</p>
    <p>All video views in Campaign-enabled players will be tracked. To view the video activity, click<strong> Video (non-MAP)</strong> in the left navigation. The Viewing Activity page will display a list of all viewed videos from SSO and Campaign tracking integrations for the selected time period. The <strong>Select Connection</strong> control can be used to select a specific connection. The calendar control can be used to select a new date range. Data can be sorted by clicking on the column headers.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Notes:
      <ul>
        <li>There will be a few hour delay before the viewing data will appear.</li>
        <li>Analytics and Campaign track via independent plugins and backend systems. It is very common to not see the same results. Campaign also adheres to things like do not track settings in the browser. For the most complete analytics, view the Analytics module reports.</li>
      </ul>
