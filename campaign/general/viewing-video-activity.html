  <h1>Viewing Video Activity</h1>
  <summary>In this topic you will learn how to view video activity in the Audience module.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>When using Audience Tracking or SSO integrations, the Audience module allows you to select a video and then view activity for that video. This allows you to see who viewed a particular video.</p>
    <p>All video views in Audience-enabled players will be tracked. To view the video activity, click<strong> Video (non-MAP)</strong> in the left navigation. The Viewing Activity page will display a list of all viewed videos from SSO and Audience tracking integrations for the selected time period. The <strong>Select Connection</strong> control can be used to select a specific connection. The calendar control can be used to select a new date range. Data can be sorted by clicking on the column headers.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Notes:
      <ul>
        <li>There will be a few hour delay before the viewing data will appear.</li>
        <li>Analytics and Audience track via independent plugins and backend systems. It is very common to not see the same results. Audience also adheres to things like do not track settings in the browser. For the most complete analytics, view the Analytics module reports.</li>
      </ul>
