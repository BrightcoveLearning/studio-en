    <p>The Campaign module provides the ability to track view events. The frequency with which view events are sent to the Campaign module is calculated dynamically based on the length of the video. Campaign will send at a minimum 4 events, one per quartile.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: View event data can be exported using the <a href="/campaign/admin/exporting-campaign-data-campaign-module.html">Export Data</a> option or by using the <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/audience/getting-started/overview-audience-api.html">Audience API</a>.</aside>
    <p>To view the view events, open the Campaign module and click&nbsp;<strong>All Recent Activity</strong> in the left navigation. The page will display the view event activity for the past 24 hours.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/campaign/general/node15863-view-events.png" /></figure>
    <p>The <strong>Show Interaction Events</strong> link will be enabled if <a href="#events">custom events or metrics</a> are attached to a view event.</p>
    <p>The page will display the following information.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Timestamp</strong> - Date and time of the video view</li>
      <li><strong>Video name and ID</strong> - Video name and Video Cloud video ID</li>
      <li><strong>Percent Watched</strong> - The point at which the viewer stopped watching the video, divided by the length of the video. For example, if a viewer watched the first 5 seconds of a two-minute video, then skipped ahead to the 55 second point, watched 5 more seconds and stopped the video (or left the page), the percent watched would be recorded as 50%.
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: For <strong>Live Videos</strong>, it's not possible to track the percent watched in Campaign. Since it is not possible to know how long it will last, the Campaign module will only track the total time watched.</aside>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Time Watched</strong> - Total time watched</li>
      <li><strong>External ID</strong> - Value used to identify the viewer, for example the Eloqua GUID, Marketo GUID, HubSpot GUID, SSO GUID or another unique value that was used to identify the viewer.</li>
      <li><strong>Status</strong> - Status of the event
        <ul>
          <li><strong>unprocessed</strong> - the event hasn't been synced to the marketing automation platform</li>
          <li><strong>synced</strong> - the event was successfully synced to the marketing automation platform</li>
          <li><strong>sync_disabled</strong> - Campaign module was configured with sync disabled so the event was skipped</li>
          <li><strong>failed</strong> - error syncing; the tool tip provides some details about what error occurred</li>
          <li><strong>unknown_contact</strong> - unknown user so the event was not synced</li>
          <li><strong>N/A</strong> - not applicable; displayed when using Custom, Campaign Tracking or Marketo Munchkin integrations</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Event data can also be filtered by status using the dropdown list at the top of the page.</p>

    <h2 id="events">Viewing interaction events</h2>
    <p>If custom metrics or events are attached to a view event, the <strong>Show Interaction Events</strong> link will be enabled. For example, if you are using a Gallery In-Page experience with a Campaign-enabled player and the experience is configured with <a href="https://gallery.support.brightcove.com/experiences/inpage/adding-interactions-page-experience.html">links, cards or any other type of interactive element</a>, the experience will send impression and conversion events to the Campaign module. These events are passed to Campaign using the Campaign custom fields. The event data will appear in the Campaign module as part of the <strong>All Recent Activity</strong>.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Interaction events may also appear when using <a href="/campaign/general/using-custom-metrics-and-events.html">Campaign custom metrics and events</a>.</aside>
    <p>The following data may be passed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Event 1</strong> - Comma-separated list of CTA names that the viewer had a chance to interact with (impression)</li>
      <li><strong>Event 2</strong> - Comma-separated list of CTA names that the viewer <strong>did</strong> interact with (conversion)</li>
      <li><strong>Metric 1</strong> - Total count of CTA impressions</li>
      <li><strong>Metric 2</strong> - Total count of CTA conversions, i.e. clicked link, form submission, etc</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To view the events, click the <strong>Show Interaction Events</strong> link in the header.</p>
