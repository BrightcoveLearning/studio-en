  <h1>Publishing a Video to Email using the Audience Module</h1>
  <summary>This topic provides an overview of how to publish a video to email using the Audience module.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>On most platforms, embedding videos directly into email isn’t possible. This isn't a Brightcove limitation, nearly every modern email system will strip out video player embed code due to security reasons. You can however, drive awareness and traffic for content by creating an email with some teaser text and a poster image. The Audience module provides the ability to select a video, player and then generate the HTML to embed inside an email message.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Publishing a video to email is also available in the Media module. For information, see <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/publish/publishing-video-email.html">Publishing a Video to Email</a>.</aside>

    <p>To publish a video to an email landing page, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Open the Audience module.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Publish to Email </strong> in the left navigation.</li>
      <li>Select a <strong>Landing Page</strong>. The dropdown list will contain a <strong>Simple Landing Page</strong> which is a system provided, unstyled sample landing page. The list will also contain any published landing page experiences that were created using the Gallery module that are using an Audience-enabled player. Using a Gallery landing page provides more flexibility over the appearance and styling of the landing page. Lead forms can also be used to capture viewer information. For more information on creating Gallery landing pages, see <a href="https://gallery.support.brightcove.com/experiences/landing/creating-landing-page-experience.html">Creating a Landing Page Experience</a>.
