  <h1>Getting Started with the Audience Module</h1>
  <summary>This topic provides an overview of the Audience module which is used to track video engagement.</summary>

    <p>The Audience module is used to track video engagement data for videos that are viewed inside of an Audience-enabled Brightcove Player. Viewing data is stored in Video Cloud and can optionally be synchronized to popular marketing automation platforms such as Eloqua, Marketo, HubSpot and Salesforce.</p>
    <p>To access the Audience module, login to Video Cloud and click <strong>Audience</strong> in the navigation header. The Audience homepage displays video engagement data which provides insights into how long videos were watched, which videos were watched, and who watched them. This allows you to better engage and convert your audiences.</p>

    <h2 id="performance">Viewing video performance</h2>
    <p>The video performance section provides high level video performance for videos that were played inside of Audience-enabled players.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Note: The Audience analytics system is separate from the general Video Cloud analytics system, and the two track data differently. Therefore you will see differences in some metrics if you compare the two. For example, the Video Cloud analytics system counts views as soon as a video starts, while the Audience analytics system does not count views until 10 seconds into the video. So if 14 viewers start the video, but 6 of them stop it before 10 seconds have played, Video Cloud analytics would show 14 views, while the Audience module would show 8.</aside>

    <p>When publishing Audience-enabled players, use the Advanced Embed (in-page) publishing code. The Standard Embed (iframe) publishing code will not work as the Audience plugin will be running inside of an iframe and therefore will be unable to access any parent page URL parameters and may not get the correct cookies.</p>
