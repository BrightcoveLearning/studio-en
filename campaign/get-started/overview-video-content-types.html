    <p>By default, Brightcove Campaign&trade; is configured so that videos will have an additional video property, <strong>Video Content Type</strong>. With this property enabled, Brightcove can compile your analytics with those of similar videos and provide more robust analytics  that includes Brightcove's Video Benchmark Score (VBS) and customized advice. This allows you to, for example, compare how your &quot;how to&quot; video is doing compared to other users &quot;how to&quot; videos. This information appears on the <strong>Dashboard</strong> page. </p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Note: While Brightcove recommends assigning Video Content Types to all videos, this field can be disabled as part of the <a href="/admin/managing-account-settings.html">account settings</a>.</aside>
