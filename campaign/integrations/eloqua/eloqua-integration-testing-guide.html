  <h1>Eloqua Integration Testing Guide</h1>
  <summary>In this topic you will learn how to verify an integration between Video Cloud and Eloqua.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>When setting up a new Eloqua integration, it can be challenging to test and confirm that video viewing data is indeed being delivered to Eloqua. In this topic, you will learn how to systematically test and confirm that the integration works and that viewing data and leads are being sent to Eloqua.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: For information on how to configure the Audience module for use with Eloqua, see&nbsp;<a href="/integrations/eloqua/integrating-video-cloud-oracle-eloqua.html">Integrating Video Cloud with Oracle Eloqua</a>.</aside>

    <h2 id="start">Before you get started</h2>
    <p>Before validating the integration it is assumed you have:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Successfully completed the <a href="/integrations/eloqua/integrating-video-cloud-oracle-eloqua.html">Brightcove Audience integration with Eloqua</a></li>
      <li>Created at least one <a href="/general/creating-audience-enabled-player.html">Audience-enabled player</a> and configured it to use the Eloqua connection</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="lead_form">Configuring a test lead form and publishing a video</h2>
    <p>For testing purposes, you will need to create and configure a custom lead form in Audience. This is an Eloqua form whose embed code you have pasted into Audience. Even if you will not be using lead forms in your production environment, this lead form is used to be sure that you are known in your database and on the page. To create a Eloqua form and configure Audience to use it, follow these steps.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Login to your Eloqua account.</li>
      <li>Create and style an Eloqua form. For information on creating a Eloqua form, see <a href="/integrations/eloqua/creating-custom-lead-forms-oracle-eloqua.html">Creating Custom Lead Forms for Oracle Eloqua</a>.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Actions &gt; View Form HTML</strong> at the top of the page.</li>
      <li>Copy the form embed code to the clipboard.</li>
      <li>Return to the Audience module.</li>
      <li>Create a new lead form using the Eloqua form embed code.</li>
      <li>Set your custom form to display the form at the 5 second mark. This way you will know exactly when it should appear.</li>
      <li>Check the box to <strong>Always show the lead form even if the lead is already known</strong>. This will ensure the form continues to display after filling it out during testing.</li>
      <li><strong>Save</strong> the form.</li>
      <li>Configure the Brightcove Player with the Eloqua connection to use the Eloqua lead form that was just created.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="preview_video">Generating a preview link to view the video</h2>
    <p>To generate a preview link to the video, follow these steps.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Open the Media module.</li>
      <li>Select a video and publish it to a web player. Make sure to select the Audience-enabled player with the lead form.</li>
      <li>Click the preview link to open the video in a new browser window. Testing this way eliminates any potential variables that could be introduced by players embedded on a HTML pages.</li>
      <li>Confirm that the video plays and that the lead form displays at the 5 second mark.</li>
      <li>Fill out the lead form using unique contact info and email address (i.e. a celebrity name or a name containing the words “bctest”) so that it can be easily found later in Eloqua. This eliminates any browser, player or database level variables. By filling out the form as a new user, we can be sure you are now a known user in Eloqua.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="confirm_data">Confirming that Audience is successfully capturing the data</h2>
    <p>Before looking for video viewing data in Eloqua, first confirm that Audience has indeed captured the video view. Note that viewing data may take up to 3 hours to display in the Audience UI. To confirm that Audience is successfully capturing the data, follow these steps.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Open the Audience module.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>All Recent Activity</strong> in the left navigation.</li>
      <li>Confirm that there is an event with a recent timestamp showing the name of the video that was just watched. The event status should be <strong>unprocessed</strong>. This indicates that Audience has captured the view but has not yet attempted to sync it to Eloqua.
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/module/integrations/eloqua/node18742-unprocessed.png" /></figure>
      </li>
      <li>To manually trigger a sync between Audience and Eloqua, click <strong>Synchronization Activity</strong> in the left navigation.</li>
      <li>From the <strong>Select Connection</strong> dropdown list, select your Eloqua integration. A <strong>Test Sync</strong> button should appear.</li>
      <li>Click<strong> Test Sync</strong> to trigger a manual sync. Note that you are limited to how often you can trigger a manual sync. By default, Audience will sync views to Eloqua once an hour.
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/module/integrations/eloqua/node18742-test-sync.png" /></figure>
      </li>
      <li>Click <strong>All Recent Activity</strong> in the left navigation.</li>
      <li>The status of your view event will be <strong>queued</strong>. It may take 15 minutes or so for the data to actually sync to Eloqua. Once the data does sync, the status will change to one of two statuses:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>synced</strong> - Indicates the user was a known user and data was successfully delivered to their activity log. The data should also be viewable in Eloqua within a few minutes.</li>
          <li><strong>unknown_contact</strong> - Indicates the user was considered unknown and Eloqua was unable to accept the data. If you get an <strong>unknown_contact</strong> status, check that you published the video using the correct player, have a Eloqua form in place and are testing using the preview link, not embedded in a page.
            <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/module/integrations/eloqua/node18742-synced.png" /></figure>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="confirm_marketo">Confirming that the video view data is in Eloqua</h2>
    <p>Once Audience has displayed a <strong>synced</strong> status, follow these steps to verify that the data is in Eloqua.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: It make take 5-10 minutes for the Eloqua UI to update with the new data it has received from Audience.</aside>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Login to your Eloqua account.</li>
      <li>Navigate to the <strong>Custom Objects</strong>.</li>
      <li>Locate the <strong>BrightcoveVideoView</strong> custom object.</li>
      <li>Click on the dropdown arrow next to it and then click <strong>Custom Objects Records Mapped to Contacts Breakdown</strong>. A list of contacts who have video viewing data in this custom object will be displayed.</li>
      <li>Locate the unique name or email address you used when filling out the lead form.</li>
      <li>Click on the contact to open up the details page. A list of all video view records for the contact will be displayed. This is the video view data delivered from Audience to Eloqua. Fields such as Video Name, Video ID, Player ID, Time Watched, Percent Viewed and more are included.
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/module/integrations/eloqua/node18742-eloqua-info.png" /></figure>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Eloqua requires data being delivered into a Custom Data Object be assigned to a known contact. Eloqua will only accept data of known contacts. Data of unknown contacts will not be synced. If you don't use lead forms, there is no way for an unknown user to convert to a known user and thus no data will be synced.</p>
