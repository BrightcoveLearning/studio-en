    <p>The Campaign module provides the ability to create lead forms which allow you to capture viewer information as videos are played inside of Brightcove players. This gives you the ability to include whatever fields you need (visible or hidden) and also give you the ability to take advantage of features like progressive profiling (if available). The lead data is sent to, and processed by, Eloqua.</p>
    <p>To create a custom lead form, the following steps must be performed.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="#form">Create a form in Eloqua</a></li>
      <li><a href="#edit">Copy the form HTML</a></li>

    <h2 id="form">Creating a form in Eloqua</h2>
    <p>Eloqua provides the ability to create forms to capture viewer information. These forms can be displayed inside of Brightcove Players. The data that is captured can then be used in customizing future communications. The steps below will create a simple form to capture first name, last name and email address. For complete details on Eloqua Forms, see the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/marketingcs_gs/OMCAA/Help/Forms/Forms.htm">Eloqua documentation</a>.</p>

      <li>Sign in to your Eloqua account.</li>
      <li>Navigate to <strong>Assets</strong> &gt; <strong>Forms</strong> and then click <strong>Create a Form</strong>. The form Template Chooser opens.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Blank Form</strong> and then click <strong>Choose</strong>.</li>

      <li>By default, the fields are added using a field merge. This will cause strange text to appear in the fields when used in Campaign. To remove the field merge, select the <strong>First Name</strong> field by clicking on it.</li>
      <li>In the left navigation panel, locate the <strong>General Properties</strong> section and set the <strong>Prepopulate field data</strong> property to <strong>None</strong>.

    <h2 id="styleform">Styling the form</h2>
    <p>By default, when the form is displayed inside of a Brightcove Player, the form will display on a transparent background over the player. You will probably want to do some basic styling to the form using CSS. The sections below provide two examples of how the form can be styled. The associated CSS is also provided. You may need to adapt the CSS to conform to your standard colors or to handle styling of additional fields.</p>
    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>Simple form styling example</h3>
      <p>This example uses CSS to change the background color of the form to grey and the form will appear as follows:</p>
      <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/campaign/integrations/eloqua/node16109-simple-styling.png" /></figure>
      <p>For this styling, add the following CSS to the top of the form HTML <code translate="No">style</code> tag.</p>
      <pre>
body {
      background-color: rgba(204,204,204,0.9);
      margin: 0;
      padding: 20px;
      height: 100%;
}
  </pre>
