  <h1>Using the Audience Module to Track Viewers</h1>
  <summary>In this topic you will learn how the Audience module can be used to track viewer activity.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>The Audience module provides the ability to track viewing activity. In this scenario, viewing data is not sent to a marketing automation platform. One common use case for this would be internal training videos. Audience tracking can be used to track the viewing activity of internal employees. To use Audience tracking, the following steps are required:</p>

    <h2 id="enable">Configuring the Audience tracking settings</h2>
    <p>To configure the Audience tracking settings, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Open the Audience module and then click <strong>Data Connections</strong> in the left navigation.</li>
      <li>Locate the <strong>AUDIENCE TRACKING</strong> section and click <strong>Show</strong>.</li>
      <li>By default, Audience tracking is enabled for all accounts. Edit the settings as needed:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Connection Name</strong> - Identifies the connection</li>
          <li><strong>Connection Status</strong> - Determines if Video Cloud video engagement data is saved by the Audience module.
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Enabled</strong> - Data is collected</li>
              <li><strong>Disabled</strong> - No data is collected (connection is disabled)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Track Data for Unknown Viewers</strong> - Determines if tracking data is recorded for unknown viewers. To identify viewers when using Audience tracking, an <a href="/general/creating-audience-lead-form.html">Audience lead form</a> can be used.
            <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: With Audience tracking, up to 1,000 viewers will be tracked per 24 hour period.</aside>
          </li>
          <li><strong>How long should Brightcove retain data?</strong> - The data retention policy determines how long the viewing data and lead form data (if using an Audience lead form) will be retained in your Video Cloud account. You should adjust the retention settings according to your privacy policy - it is not required to retain any user data in Video Cloud.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="configure">Configuring a player and lead form for Audience tracking</h2>
    <p>Viewing activity can only be tracked when videos are viewed inside of an Audience-enabled video player. You must use an Audience-enabled player when using Audience Tracking. Lead forms can be displayed during video playback to capture viewer information. Lead forms are not required when using Audience tracking.</p>
    <p>To configure Audience Tracking with an Audience-enabled player and lead form, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Click <strong>Audience Players</strong> in the left navigation.</li>
      <li>Determine which Audience-enabled player to use. If no Audience-enabled players exist, click <strong>Create Player</strong> to create one. For more information on creating Audience-enabled players, see <a href="/general/creating-audience-enabled-player.html">Creating an Audience-enabled Player</a>.</li>
      <li>While a lead form is not required, lead forms can be used to collect information about the viewer and turn anonymous viewers into known viewers. Click <strong>Lead Forms</strong> and create a lead form. For more information on creating lead forms, see <a href="/general/creating-audience-lead-form.html">Creating an Audience Lead Form</a>.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Audience Players</strong>.</li>
      <li>Locate the Audience-enabled player to use. Set the <strong>Connect To</strong> value for the player to <strong>Audience Tracking</strong>.</li>
      <li>If a lead form is being used, select the lead form from the <strong>Lead Form</strong> dropdown list.
