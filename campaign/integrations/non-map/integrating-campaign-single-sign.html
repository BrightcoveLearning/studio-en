    <p>The Audience module provides the ability to track viewing activity when the viewer has logged into a system using single sign-on (SSO). In this scenario, viewing data is not sent to a marketing automation platform. With an Audience SSO configuration, SAML attribute(s) are passed to Audience to identify the viewer. One common use case for this would be internal training videos. Employees might be required to login to watch videos and then their viewing activity can be tracked and then viewed inside the Audience module. To enable Audience for use with SSO, the following steps are required:</p>

    <h2 id="sso">Configuring SSO software</h2>
    <p>The steps to install and configure SSO software is outside the scope of this topic. The SSO software should be configured so users have to authenticate themselves before they can view Video Cloud videos. The SSO software should be configured to expose some user attributes so they can be accessed from an external application. For example, this Okta SSO configuration exposes three attributes, <code translate="No">FirstName</code>, <code translate="No">LastName</code> and <code translate="No">Email</code>.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="okta setup" src="/assets/images/campaign/general/node18363-okta.png" /></figure>
    <p>In this topic, the <code translate="No">Email</code> attribute will be used to identify viewers to the Audience module.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Even though your SSO software can be configured to expose multiple attributes, Audience will only use a single attribute to track viewers.</aside>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="attributes">Configuring an application to access SSO attributes</h2>
    <p>The application or website that will be used to view Video Cloud videos should be configured so that the SSO attributes are made available to Audience using JavaScript. This configuration will vary based upon the application or website being used. In the following example, an SSO access control profile was created in Gallery. As part of the configuration, the <code translate="No">Email</code> SSO attribute is being exposed and will be available inside the Gallery site. This is the value that will be used to identify viewers to the Audience module.</p>

    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Open the Audience module and click <strong>Data Connections</strong> in the left navigation.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Add New Connection</strong>.</li>
      <li>Select <strong>SSO</strong> as the integration.
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: The integrations that are available are based upon your Video Cloud subscription.</aside>
      </li>
      <li>(Optional) Enter a <strong>Connection Name</strong>.

      </li>
      <li>Click <strong>Connect</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The SSO connection is now set up and ready to use.</p>

    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Click the <code translate="No">empty</code> link in the <strong>SSO Property</strong> section. Enter the name of the JavaScript value to look for in the page. In this example, Gallery was configured to expose the <code translate="No">Email</code> SSO attribute so that is what is being used here.

        <p>In this topic, the Audience SSO integration will be used to track viewing activity. Click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: It is also possible to leave the <strong>SSO Property</strong> empty and then use one of the <a href="#identify">additional options</a> to identify viewers.</aside>
      </li>
      <li>By default, the <strong>Connection Status</strong> will be <strong>Enabled</strong>. The <strong>Connection Status</strong> determines if Video Cloud video engagement data is saved.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Enabled</strong> - Data is collected</li>
          <li><strong>Disabled</strong> - No data is collected (integration is disabled)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Select a data retention policy. The data retention policy determines how long the viewing data and lead form data (if using an Audience lead form) will be retained in your Video Cloud account. <strong>You should adjust the retention settings according to your privacy policy</strong>.
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="data retention options" src="/assets/images/campaign/general/node18363-data-retention-options.png" /></figure>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>To remove the integration, click <strong>Disconnect</strong>. The bottom of the page will list all Audience-enabled players, the connections they are associated with and the associated lead forms.</p>
    <p>The Audience module supports multiple connections to marketing platforms. Click <strong>Add New Connection</strong> to configure additional integrations.</p>

    <h2 id="identify">Additional options for identifying viewers</h2>
    <p>If you don't specify a value for the <strong>SSO Property </strong>when the integration is configured, you are responsible for identifying viewers. The Audience module needs the following information:</p>
    <table class="bcls-table">
      <thead class="bcls-table__head">
        <tr>
          <th>Description</th>
          <th>URL Parameter</th>
          <th>Embed Parameter</th>
          <th>Value</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody class="bcls-table__body">
        <tr>
          <td>What’s the GUID (needed for view event tracking)</td>
          <td><code translate="No">bcssoguid</code></td>
          <td><code translate="No">data-bc-sso-guid</code></td>
          <td><code translate="No">string</code></td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>This parameter can be passed in via a URL parameter or through the player embed code. For viewer tracking to occur, this parameter should be passed as a URL parameter on the page that is displaying the video.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: In order for the player/plugin to read the URL parameter, the Advanced (in-page) embed code should be used. The Standard (iframe) embed code will not work as the plugin will be running inside of an iframe and therefore is unable to access the parent page URL which has the parameter.</aside>
    <p>It’s also possible to pass the GUID to the Audience player using a JavaScript value that’s available in the page. Using the player config, it’s possible to tell Audience what the name of the JavaScript variable is and Audience will then attempt to read that variable using it as the custom GUID. To do this, edit the Audience player and configure the plugin options for the Audience plugin.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="plugin params" src="/assets/images/campaign/general/node18363-plugin-params.png" /></figure>
    <p>In the above example, the player config is telling Audience that there’s a JavaScript object in the page called <code translate="No">samlAttributes</code> and it has a property called <code translate="No">nameID</code>. Audience will attempt to read that and use its value for the custom GUID.</p>
