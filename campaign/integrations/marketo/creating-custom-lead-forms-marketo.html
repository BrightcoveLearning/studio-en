    <p>The Audience module provides the ability to create lead forms which allow you to capture viewer information as videos are played inside of Brightcove players. This gives you the ability to include whatever fields you need (visible or hidden) and also give you the ability to take advantage of features like progressive profiling (if available). The lead data is sent to, and processed by, Marketo.</p>
    <p>To create a custom lead form, the following steps must be performed.</p>

      <li><a href="#formcss">Optional - Style the form using CSS</a></li>

    <h2 id="form">Creating a form</h2>
    <p>Marketo provides the ability to create forms to capture viewer information. These forms can be displayed inside of Audience-enabled Brightcove players. The data that is captured can then be used in customizing future communications. The steps below will create a simple form to capture first name, last name and email address. For complete details on Marketo Forms, see the <a href="https://docs.marketo.com/display/public/DOCS/Forms">Marketo documentation</a>.</p>
