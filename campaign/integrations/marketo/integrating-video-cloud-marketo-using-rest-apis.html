    <p>The Audience module allows Video Cloud to synchronize viewing data from Brightcove Players to Marketo. Once in Marketo, this data can be used for segmentation, campaign logic, reports, lead scoring, and personalizing communications.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: For information on how to configure the Audience module for use with Marketo using the Munchkin ID, see <a href="/campaign/integrations/marketo/integrating-video-cloud-marketo-using-munchkin.html">Integrating Video Cloud with Marketo using Munchkin</a>.</aside>
    <p>The Audience module integration with Marketo consists of two main components:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A Brightcove Player plug-in to enable tracking of video views data</li>
      <li>A Synchronization process to send tracking data from Video Cloud to Marketo</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
    <p>To use the Audience module with the Marketo REST integration, you must:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a role in Marketo which has access to all of the API permissions</li>
      <li>Create a LaunchPoint Service</li>
      <li>Have a Professional or Enterprise Video Cloud account</li>
      <li>Have the Audience module enabled for your account by submitting the required information in the initial splash screen that appears when you open the Audience module</li>
      <li>Click through the service agreement the first time you use the module</li>
      <li>Use the Advanced Embed (in-page) publishing code when publishing your player; Standard Embed (iframe) publishing code will not work as the plugin will be running inside of an iframe and therefore will be unable to access any parent page URL parameters and may not get the correct cookies</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="api">Creating an API-only user and LaunchPoint service</h2>
    <p>Before you can make a call to the Marketo REST API, you need to create a new API role with access to all of the APIs, create an API-only user and then create a service that uniquely identifies your client application. The steps to complete these tasks are outlined in the <a href="https://developers.marketo.com/blog/quick-start-guide-for-marketo-rest-api/">Marketo documentation</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="setupConnection">Setting up the connection</h2>
    <p>Once the configuration steps on the Marketo side have been completed, follow these steps to setup the connection between Video Cloud and Marketo.</p>

        <p>You will required to paste in several values from your Marketo account. Note that you must be logged in as a Marketo administrator to complete the following steps. For the following steps, click the empty link and provide the appropriate value:</p>
      </li>

    <h2 id="configure">Configuring the integration</h2>
    <p>Once the Video Cloud to Marketo connection has been made, you can configure the integration.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="connected options" src="/assets/images/campaign/integrations/marketo/node16341-connected-options.png" /></figure>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>By default, the <strong>Connection Status</strong> will be <strong>Enabled</strong>. The <strong>Connection Status</strong> determines if Video Cloud video engagement data is sent to Marketo.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Enabled</strong> - Data is collected and will be sent to Marketo</li>
          <li><strong>Disabled</strong> - No data is collected (integration is disabled)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>By default, <strong>Track Data for Unknown Viewers</strong> will be set to <strong>Disabled</strong>. Enabling this option will track data for unknown users. Data will be retained based upon the selected data retention policy. If data retention is set to <strong>No retention</strong>, this field is not displayed.</li>
      <li>Select a data retention policy. The data retention policy determines whether, and for how long, the lead information data that you capture will be retained in your Video Cloud account as well as in Marketo. Retaining data in Video Cloud allows you to recover from interrupted synchronizations. However, <strong>you should adjust the retention settings according to your privacy policy</strong> - it is not required to retain any user data in Video Cloud. Data will be deleted after the data retention period.

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="player">Creating an Audience-enabled player</h2>
    <p>Video engagement data will only be sent to Marketo when you are using an Audience-enabled video player. For information on creating an Audience-enabled Brightcove Player, see <a href="/campaign/general/creating-audience-enabled-player.html">Creating an Audience-enabled Player</a>.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="identify">Identifying viewers</h2>
    <p>Audience-enabled players with a Marketo integration will refer to the Munchkin cookie (_mkto_trk) which is created in the user's browser. This value is captured in the Audience moduleâ€™s viewing data and is used to synchronize viewing data to Marketo.</p>
    <p>The user's email address can be passed in a <strong>bcemail</strong> URL parameter on the page that is displaying the video. For more information and an example, see <a href="/campaign/general/how-audience-module-identifies-viewers.html#email">How the Audience Module Identifies Viewers</a>.</p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="verify">Verifying the integration</h2>
    <p>When the integration is configured, test the integration to confirm that video view data is being sent to Marketo.
