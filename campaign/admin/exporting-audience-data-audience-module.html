  <h1>Exporting Audience Data from the Audience Module</h1>
  <summary>In this topic you will learn how to export view event data and lead form data.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>View events are recorded as videos are watched using Audience-enabled players. Lead data is captured as users enter data into Audience lead forms. The Audience module offers two types of lead forms:</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Audience lead forms</strong> - These forms are built by selecting from a set of predefined fields in the Audience module. These forms save lead data in Video Cloud. For information on creating Audience lead forms, see <a href="/general/creating-audience-lead-form.html">Creating an Audience Lead Form</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Custom lead forms</strong> - These forms are built using your marketing automation platform. The form embed code is then used in the Audience module to create a custom lead form. These forms send lead data to the marketing automation platform. For information on creating lead forms, see the document for your marketing platform:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="/integrations/eloqua/creating-custom-lead-forms-oracle-eloqua.html">Eloqua</a></li>
          <li><a href="/integrations/marketo/creating-custom-lead-forms-marketo.html">Marketo</a></li>
          <li><a href="/integrations/salesforce/creating-custom-lead-forms-salesforce.html">Salesforce</a></li>
          <li><a href="/integrations/hubspot/creating-custom-lead-forms-hubspot.html">HubSpot</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When exporting lead data from the Audience module, only data captured using Audience lead forms will be exported. Lead data from custom lead forms will be stored in your marketing automation software.</p>
