    <p>View events are recorded as videos are watched using Campaign-enabled players. Lead data is captured as users enter data into Campaign lead forms. The Campaign module offers two types of lead forms:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Campaign lead forms</strong> - These forms are built by selecting from a set of predefined fields in the Campaign module. These forms save lead data in Video Cloud. For information on creating Campaign lead forms, see <a href="/campaign/general/creating-campaign-lead-form.html">Creating a Campaign Lead Form</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Custom lead forms</strong> - These forms are built using your marketing automation platform. The form embed code is then used in the Campaign module to create a custom lead form. These forms send lead data to the marketing automation platform. For information on creating lead forms, see the document for your marketing platform:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="/campaign/integrations/eloqua/creating-custom-lead-forms-oracle-eloqua.html">Eloqua</a></li>
          <li><a href="/campaign/integrations/marketo/creating-custom-lead-forms-marketo.html">Marketo</a></li>
          <li><a href="/campaign/integrations/salesforce/creating-custom-lead-forms-salesforce.html">Salesforce</a></li>
          <li><a href="/campaign/integrations/hubspot/creating-custom-lead-forms-hubspot.html">HubSpot</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When exporting lead data from the Campaign module, only data captured using Campaign lead forms will be exported. Lead data from custom lead forms will be stored in your marketing automation software.</p>
