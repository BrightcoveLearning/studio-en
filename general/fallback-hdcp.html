    <h2 id="What_is_HDCP">What is HDCP?</h2>
    <p>High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) is a form of digital copy protection used to protect audio and video signals from being copied on unauthorized devices. To make a device HDCP compatible, the manufacturer must obtain a license from the Intel subsidiary, Digital Content Protection LLC, and pay an annual fee. There are three types of security rules: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Data traveling through HDCP-enabled cabling is encrypted to stay hidden from cyber criminals</li>
      <li>Digital devices that have been compromised have their keys taken away, so the device can no longer get data</li>
      <li>Authentication prevents data and content from being sent to devices that donâ€™t have a license</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For details, see the Wikipedia page about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-bandwidth_Digital_Content_Protection">High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="How_does_Brightcove_protect_your_content_using_HDCP">How does Brightcove protect your content using HDCP?</h2>
    <p>Content owners may want to protect their content with DRM and force HDCP for specific hardware setups. For devices that don't support HDCP, Brightcove will provide a fallback experience using lower quality SD renditions.</p>
    <!-- <h3>Keys</h3> -->
    <p>To accomplish this, we use multiple keys that unlock different renditions. The player uses a DRM keychain for multiple keys and switches as needed. There will be three keys for each protection type instead of just one.</p>
    <p>There will be one key for each:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>audio</li>
      <li>HD</li>
      <li>SD</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Workflow</h3>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>Enable your account for HDCP fallback.</li>
      <li>The player makes a request to the Playback API for video content.</li>
      <li>If the player finds HDCP-protected video data, then it will check the device.</li>
      <li>For HDCP-enabled devices, the player will use the associated DRM key and play the encrypted HD renditions.</li>
      <li>For hardware that is not HDCP compliant, playback will use SD renditions with a lower level of protection.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>All renditions will be protected with DRM</li>
      <li>Each key is set to unlock multiple renditions, allowing Brightcove to continue to deliver the best rendition for the device being used</li>
    </ul>
