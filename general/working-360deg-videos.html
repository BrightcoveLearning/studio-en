    <h1>Working with 360° Videos</h1>
    <summary>In this topic you will learn how to work with 360-degree videos in Video Cloud.</summary>
    <p>360° videos are video recordings where a view in every direction is recorded at the same time. 360° videos are shot using an omnidirectional camera or a collection of cameras. During playback the viewer has control of the viewing direction like a panorama.</p>
    <p>Video Cloud supports uploading and publishing of 360° videos. A sample 360° video is shown below. Once you play the video, you can use either your mouse or the arrow keys to control the view on the desktop, or the gyroscope if viewing on a mobile device.</p>

    <h2 id="record">Recording 360° videos</h2>
    <p>360° video is typically recorded using either a special rig of multiple cameras or using a dedicated camera that contains multiple camera lenses. The resulting footage is then stitched to form a single video. There are many cameras available to record 360° video. The 360° video in this topic was recorded using a Ricoh Theta S. Brightcove recommends recording your video at a high resolution.</p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="before">Before you upload</h2>
    <p>Before you upload a 360° video to Video Cloud, the video file needs to include certain metadata for 360° playback to be enabled. The Spatial Media Metadata Injector application can be used to add metadata to a video file indicating that the file contains 360° video. If the 360° video was recorded on a camera that doesn't automatically add the 360° metadata, follow these steps to add it:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Download the 360° Video Metadata app for <a href="https://github.com/google/spatial-media/releases/download/v2.0/360.Video.Metadata.Tool.mac.zip">Mac</a> or <a href="https://github.com/google/spatial-media/releases/download/v2.0/360.Video.Metadata.Tool.win.zip">Windows</a>.</li>
      <li>Install and then open the 360° Video Metadata app.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Open</strong> and then select the video file.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Inject metadata</strong>.</li>
      <li>Enter a name for the new file and then click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The video is now ready to be uploaded to Video Cloud.</p>

    <h2 id="upload">Uploading 360° videos</h2>
    <p>360° video is filmed to be projected on the interior of a sphere. This means that the visible area of the video in the player is only a fraction of the entire video. The following screenshot gives you a rough idea of this concept. The area inside the red rectangle is what is visible in the player, but it is only a small part of the entire video.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="player view" src="/assets/images/general/node16784-player-view.png" /></figure>
    <p>Since only a small part of the video will be in the player at any one time, you want a very high quality rendition to be playing, with no chance of a lower quality rendition appearing. In essence, you are "zooming in" on part of the video and a poor quality rendition would yield a very poor quality viewing experience. When uploading your video, Brightcove recommends creating a custom Dynamic Delivery ingest profile with a single 1080p rendition and at least one audio rendition.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: For information on creating custom ingest profiles, see <a href="/admin/managing-ingest-profiles.html">Managing Ingest Profiles</a>. Some care should be taken as mobile devices sometimes have fixed bitrate and resolution limits. Some old mobile devices may fail to play 360° videos higher than 1080p.</aside>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="props">360° video properties</h2>
    <p>All Video Cloud videos have a set of properties that can be set using Video Cloud Studio or programmatically using the CMS API. Note that not all of the properties are exposed in Video Cloud Studio.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: For a list of all the video properties, see the <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/cms/references/cms-api-video-fields-reference.html">CMS API Video Fields Reference</a> document.</aside>
    <p>To indicate that a video is a 360° video, use the Media module to edit the video properties and set the <strong>Video Projection</strong> property to <strong>360°</strong>.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: The <span translate="No">CMS API</span> can also be used to set the <strong><code translate="No">projection</code></strong> property to <strong>equirectangular</strong>. For more information, see <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/cms/managing-videos/setting-360-degree-video-properties-cms-api.html">Setting 360° Video Properties with the CMS API</a> document.</aside>

    <h2 id="publish">Publishing 360° videos</h2>
    <p>Brightcove provides several ways you can publish 360° videos:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#web">Brightcove Players on a web page</a></li>
      <li><a href="#social">Brightcove Social</a></li>
      <li><a href="#sdk">Brightcove Native Player SDKs</a></li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: To use the latest version of the 360°/VR Plugin, you must be using Brightcove Player version 6.13.0 or later.</aside>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: In order for the 360°/VR plugin to render videos correctly on iOS devices, the <strong>Preload Video </strong><strong>Before Playback</strong> setting must be set to <strong>Yes</strong> as part of the <a href="/players/configuring-player-playback-properties.html">player properties</a>.</aside>

      <h3>Publishing 360° videos to web pages</h3>
      <p>To play 360° videos in a Brightcove Player, the player requires the 360°/VR Video Plugin.</p>
      <p>To create a new Brightcove Player with the 360°/VR Video Plugin, follow these steps:</p>
      <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
        <li>Open the <strong>Players</strong> module.</li>
        <li>Create a new player.</li>
        <li>Click the player name to open the player properties.</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Plugins</strong> in the left navigation.
          <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: This plugin is compatible with Brightcove Player version 6.x only.</aside>
        </li>
        <li>Click <strong>Add a Plugin &gt; Custom Plugin</strong>.</li>
        <li>For the <strong>Plugin Name</strong>, enter <strong>vr</strong>.</li>
        <li>For the <strong>JavaScript URL</strong>, enter:
          <pre>
<code class="language-javascript" translate="No">//players.brightcove.net/videojs-vr/1/videojs-vr.min.js</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>For the <strong>CSS URL</strong>, enter:
          <pre>
<code class="language-javascript" translate="No">//players.brightcove.net/videojs-vr/1/videojs-vr.css</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>No <strong>Options(JSON)</strong> are needed.</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Save</strong> and then <strong>Publish</strong> the player.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>You can now publish the 360° video using the player that was just created.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3 id="social">Publishing 360° videos using Brightcove Social</h3>
      <p>360° videos uploaded to your Video Cloud account can easily be published to your social media accounts using Brightcove Social. Note that when using the Social module to sync a 360° video, the ingest profile used to ingest the video must be configured to save the master file or the video won't sync in 360°. When Video Cloud ingests 360° videos, the 360° metadata isn't retained in the resulting renditions. When syncing a 360° video without a master, the highest quality rendition is used in the sync. As the rendition doesn't include the 360° metadata, YouTube/Facebook won't know it's a 360° video.</p>
      <p>For information on publishing videos using Brightcove Social, see <a href="https://social.support.brightcove.com/general/publishing-videos-social-media-platforms.html">Publishing Videos to Social Media Platforms</a>.</p>

    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3 id="sdk">Publishing 360° videos using the Brightcove Native Player SDKs</h3>
      <p>Android and iOS apps built using the Brightcove Player SDKs can play 360° videos. For information on publishing 360° videos with the SDKs, see the <a href="https://sdks.support.brightcove.com/features/using-360deg-videos-native-sdks.html">Using 360° Videos with the Native SDKs</a> document.</p>
