title: Protecting Videos with HLS Encryption
description: This topic describes how to protect your videos playing on desktop and mobile devices with HLS encryption. HLS encryption must be enabled for your account if you wish to use it - contact your Account Manager for more information. Note that once enabled for the account, all videos ingested after that will use HLSe.
