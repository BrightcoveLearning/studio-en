    <h2 id="benefits">Benefits of using multiple accounts</h2>
    <p>There are a number of benefits of having multiple Video Cloud accounts.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Multiple accounts enable separate groups, divisions, affiliates, or properties of your company/organization to manage content separately, as well as have their own players, playlists, analytics and account settings.</li>
      <li>Multiple accounts allow you to create and capture different metadata for videos in different accounts</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="users">Managing users</h2>
    <p>A common misconception when adding an additional account is that you get an additional 10 users just like you did with your first Video Cloud account. Additional Video Cloud accounts do not include additional user accounts. For example, if 10 users were added to the first account and the same 10 users are added to the second account, the total user count is still 10. The 10 unique users are per the license agreement and a single unique user ID can be used on multiple accounts and still be counted as one user. To learn more about managing users, see <a href="/admin/managing-users.html">Managing Users</a>.</p>
    <p>If you have multiple accounts, users must be added to each account individually. Assume you have 2 accounts, Account A and Account B. If a user is added to Account A, they will not automatically have access to Account B. Users must be added to each account they need access to.</p>

    <h2 id="strategies">Strategies for organizing multiple accounts</h2>
    <p>There are a number of ways you might choose to organize your content when you have multiple accounts.</p>
    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>Type of content or audience</h3>
      <p>You may choose to organize your Video Cloud content based upon the type of content or the intended audience. For example, you might have paid content in a separate account from your free content or have internal content separated from public content. One advantage of doing it this way is what will be displayed on the video end screen. If you choose to show related videos, you can ensure that paid content will only be shown to users who should have access to it. Also, content that is considered internal content will not be displayed to viewers outside the organization.</p>
      <h3>Organizational structure</h3>
      <p>You may choose to organize content based upon your organizational structure. For example, the content produced by the Marketing department and the Tech Support department will be in separate accounts. The first advantage to organizing accounts by organizational structure is that you can create users for each account and control who has access to each account. If needed, you can give users access to multiple accounts. Video Cloud also supports media sharing which allows you to share content across accounts if needed. The second advantage to organizing accounts by organizational structure is that each department can choose to distribute their content in their Video Cloud account to their YouTube channel using Video Cloud's distribution feature.</p>

    <h2 id="limitations">Limitations when using multiple accounts</h2>
    <p>Below are some of the limitations when using multiple accounts.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Players can't be shared across accounts</li>
      <li>Playlists can't be shared across accounts. Using the <span translate="No">CMS API</span> however, it is possible to retrieve playlist data from one account and create identical playlists in other accounts, if they are smart playlists based on the same selection criteria.</li>
    </ul>
