    <h2 id="What_is_HDCP">What is HDCP?</h2>
    <p>High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) is a form of digital copy protection used to protect high definition (HD) video and audio signals from being copied on unauthorized devices. The transmitting device first checks if the receiver is authorized to receive data. If yes, then the transmitter sends encrypted data to prevent eavesdropping.</p>
    <p>The recieving setup must be HDCP compliant, including devices, cables, adaptors, and software drivers. If the receiver is not HDCP compliant, then video will play in standard definition (SD) only. In general, newer HDTVs and HDMI or DVI cables should be HDCP compliant.</p>
    <p>To make a device HDCP compatible, the manufacturer must obtain a license from the Intel subsidiary, Digital Content Protection LLC, and pay an annual fee. There are three types of security rules:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Data traveling through HDCP-enabled cabling is encrypted to stay hidden from cyber criminals</li>
      <li>Digital devices that have been compromised have their keys taken away, so the device can no longer get data</li>
      <li>Authentication prevents data and content from being sent to devices that donâ€™t have a license</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For details about HDCP, see the Wikipedia page about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-bandwidth_Digital_Content_Protection">High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="How_does_Brightcove_protect_your_content_using_HDCP">How does Brightcove protect your content using HDCP?</h2>
    <p>Content owners may want to protect their content with DRM and force HDCP for specific hardware setups. For devices that don't support HDCP, Brightcove will provide a fallback experience using lower quality SD renditions.</p>
    <h3>Keys</h3>
    <p>To accomplish this, we use multiple keys that unlock different renditions. The player uses a DRM keychain for multiple keys and switches as needed. There will be three keys for each protection type instead of just one.</p>
    <p>There will be one key for each:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>audio</li>
      <li>HD</li>
      <li>SD</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Workflow</h3>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>Enable your account for HDCP fallback.</li>
      <li>The player makes a request to the Playback API for video content.</li>
      <li>If the player finds HDCP-protected video data, then it will check the device.</li>
      <li>For HDCP-enabled devices, the player will use the associated DRM key and play the encrypted HD renditions.</li>
      <li>For hardware that is not HDCP compliant, playback will use SD renditions with a lower level of protection.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>All renditions will be protected with DRM</li>
      <li>Each key is set to unlock multiple renditions, allowing Brightcove to continue to deliver the best rendition for the device being used</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A common implementation solution is to stream premium HD content only on devices supporting L1 security. Most Android devices for instance support L1 security. L2 and L3 devices (such as Chrome on Desktops) on the other hand receive standard-quality video streams.</p>
