    <p>If you forget your password to your Studio account, you can request that the password be automatically reset by clicking the <a href="https://signin.brightcove.com/forgotPassword"><strong>Forgot your password?</strong></a> link on the login screen.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/general/node10768-login-screen.png" /></figure>
    <p>Simply enter your registered email address, enter the CAPTCHA text and click <span class="button-blue">Continue</span>. You will receive an email from Brightcove with a link that will allow you to create a new password. If you don't see an email in your inbox, check your spam or junk folders. If you still don't see an email, perhaps you aren't using the email address that is currently registered to your account and you should try another email address. <a href="https://supportportal.brightcove.com">Brightcove Customer Support</a> is also available to help.</p>
    <p>If you aren't sure if you remember your password, it is best to reset your password right away. Don't try to guess! If you try to guess your password and you fail several times, you will lock yourself out of the account which will then require assistance from our <a href="https://supportportal.brightcove.com">Customer Support</a> team.</p>
    <p>In response to security concerns, we have limited the maximum number of password resets a user may carry out in a short period. Users may reset their password three times in a 24-hour period. At the fourth attempt, the user will receive an error page reading "Password Reset Forbidden: You have exceeded the maximum number of password resets. Please contact Brightcove Support." 24 hours after the first password reset, the interval elapses and the password can be reset again.</p>
    <p>If you don't recall ever registering or receiving a login to Studio, but you need one, you should contact the person within your organization who manages the Brightcove relationship. They are most likely the Administrator of the account, or know who is an Administrator. All Administrators can create new user accounts.</p>
    <p>The Brightcove Customer Support team does not create new user accounts for any customer. The management of user accounts is up to the individual company's business policies.</p>
